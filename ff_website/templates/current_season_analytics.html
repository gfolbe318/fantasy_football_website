        Here is your home for a detailed analytical report of how your team
        stacks up against the rest of the league. With more suggestions on what
        data to include, shoot me a text. The data available is limited to team
        data (i.e. I can't run analytics on individual player performances).

      <p class="text-justify">
        This metric is calculated using a similar rotisserie fashion. The values
        were generated by looking at the points scored by each team's OPPONENT
        on a given week. If they played the team that scored the most points,
        they recieve 11 points, and if they played the team that scored the
        fewest points, they recieve 0 points. A higher number indicates a harder
        Strength of Schedule.

        The following table is used to demonstrate the record of two teams if
        they played against each other every week of the season. To read the
        table, the record in the cell represents the record of the team on the
        y-axis (left side) vs. the team on the x-axis (top row).

  <h3>Scoring Bands Analysis</h3>

  <div class="row season_intro">
    <div class="col-12">
      <p class="text-justify">
        This table is pretty self-explanatory. It shows the record of each team
        based on the quartiles that they scored in the given week with respect
        to the rest of the league. A win in the "Bottom 3 Scorer" band would be
        considered lucky, whereas a loss in the "Top 3 Scorer" band would be
        considered unlucky.
