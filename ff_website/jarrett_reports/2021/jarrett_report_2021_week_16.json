Let\u2019s get into\r\n    it.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    Jart\u2019s Mailbag\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who will win the league in 2022?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    If we run snake, I will take whoever has the 4th overall pick. If we do an\r\n    auction, I like Aross. Feel like he would be the best sharp in such a\r\n    format. But at the end of the day, the team that wins it all will be the\r\n    one with the least injuries.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>When will the lock out for auction begin?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Tuesday, January 3rd.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        With the fantasy season coming to an end, what was your favorite moment\r\n        this year?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Personal: Burrow-Chase stack clinching me a playoff spot after Penny popped\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    League-Wide: Sweating out roto the last three weeks of the season. I am\r\n    very hesitant to make roto any more influential than it is currently in our\r\n    league, but it has been a fun addition.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>How are you spending New Years? </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I spent most of it driving home from a conference in Minnesota, got back a\r\n    little before midnight CT and then watched some TV and fell asleep on the\r\n    couch. Wild times.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Why is Brad such a b*tch? Will Nath ever stop being mad? </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I think Brad just likes stirring the pot. Nath will always be mad but then\r\n    say he\u2019s not.<strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        What are your thoughts on the Louisiana purchase and its impact on\r\n        climate change?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I\u2019ve done a lot of research on this one, and the part that stood out to me\r\n    the most was:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cRich in gold, silver and other ores, as well as huge forests and endless\r\n    lands for grazing and farming, the new acquisition would make America\r\n    immensely wealthy. Or, as Jefferson put it in his usual understated way,\r\n    \u2018The fertility of the country, its climate and extent, promise in due\r\n    season important aids to our treasury, an ample provision for our\r\n    posterity, and a wide-spread field for the blessings of freedom.\u2019\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Given that the US doesn\u2019t care about climate change, all of this money and\r\n    land has clearly had a negative impact on the climate. So while I was a fan\r\n    of the Louisiana purchase given that we acquired it for around 4 cents per\r\n    acre, the climate has paid the price.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Projected standings for next year\u2019s regular season? </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        Aross\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        NN\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jase!\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        CJ\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Gart\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Bank\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jart\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        MW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        JL\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Brad\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Nooni\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>How will Michigan lose this week? </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>A.
