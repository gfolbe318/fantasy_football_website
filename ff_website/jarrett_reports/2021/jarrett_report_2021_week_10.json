But instead, we\u2019re going\r\n    to produce a composite here.\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jonathan Taylor, Dmichs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Najee Harris, NN\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Austin Ekeler, JL\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Cooper Kupp, NN\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Ezekiel Elliott, Folbe\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Joe Mixon, JL\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        James Conner, Bank\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Alvin Kamara, Jase\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        D\u2019Andre Swift, Jart\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Nick Chubb, CJ\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dalvin Cook, Aross\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Tyreek Hill, Jart\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        What is your realistic prediction for JL the rest of the season?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    It was not going to be very favorable had Deebo not dropped 27 and gotten\r\n    JL to 9-1 last night. Left on the schedule is Folbe, Jart, CJ, Jason. I\r\n    think the most likely result there is 2-2, leaving JL at 11-3. Considering\r\n    Alex will probably play the lowest PF team every week the rest of the\r\n    season, they\u2019ll both be 11-3, but JL will have the tiebreaker by like 600\r\n    points. So he\u2019ll have the 1 seed and a first round bye. In the semi-finals\r\n    he\u2019d face the winner of the 4/5 matchup, which as of today is Folbe-CJ. I\r\n    think his most likely opponent in this round in NN though, and I think NN\r\n    just has too much firepower for JL. So I think semi-final exit is the most\r\n    likely result, but a trip to the finals would not surprise me. He still has\r\n    the best odds to win it all in my mind given his first round bye and Aross\r\n    winning last night.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who was the worst draft pick?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Excluding players who have missed time because of injuries since only Dr.\r\n    Banooni can see those coming, I think the answer has to be Allen Robinson.\r\n    It was certainly a surprise that he has been so horrendous, but he\u2019s the\r\n    #64 WR in fantasy this season and has yet to score 10 points in a game.\r\n    He\u2019s borderline droppable, which is certainly not what one would have\r\n    expected, including myself who was pretty high on him this season. If we\r\n    count injured players, it\u2019s probably Saquon Barkley.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Best draft pick by round?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        Najee Harris, NN. Ekeler may have slightly better numbers so far, but\r\n        Najee went a couple picks later, so he gets the slight edge.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jonathan Taylor, Dmichs. Also self-explanatory.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        James Robinson, MW. Not because he\u2019s been amazing, but because the 3rd\r\n        rd of our draft was atrocious.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        D\u2019Andre Swift, Jart. Also not a great round for the league, but Swift\r\n        is a top-10 back pretty much every week.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Darrell Henderson, Jase. That guy is just nice, even with last night\u2019s\r\n        poor showing. Honorable mention here to Brandon Aiyuk, NN.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Ja\u2019Marr Chase, Jart. I stopped reading the rest of the round, it\u2019s\r\n        Chase.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Tom Brady, Bank. This one was real close between Brady and Hurts, but\r\n        Brady has been slightly better. Shoutout Robby Anderson, Jason.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Deebo Samuel, JL. Also stopped reading the rest for this one.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        James Conner, Bank. Somehow he\u2019s super good. I\u2019m still a little\r\n        confused by it.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Marquise Brown, Dmichs. I love it for my nephew Hollywood, and he\u2019d\r\n        probably be WR1 on the year if he could catch.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dallas Goedert, Dmichs. Another not great round for the league, and it\r\n        was between him and McKissic. I like Goedert to be a top option the\r\n        rest of the year though at TE.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Bills D/ST, CJ. They too nice.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Chuba Hubbard, Nooni. Not much utility nowadays, but he was a solid\r\n        starting RB for weeks with McCaffrey out (which will probably happen\r\n        again soon).\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Tyler Bass, Aross. While both Elijah Moore and Rhamondre Stevenson may\r\n        be coming on now, Tyler Bass has been the consistent #1 kicker all\r\n        year.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>How Dead am I?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Good question Bank. I think we can all agree the Edmonds and Arwin injuries\r\n    help your team, so Trees is really the only loss (Ridley wasn\u2019t even that\r\n    good when he played). Devonta and Hunter have both been solid WR2s, so I\r\n    don\u2019t think you\u2019re dead at all. I could see this being one of your best\r\n    weeks yet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>40 Yard Dash Finish Predictions?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        CJ.

I\u2019m not convinced about this one since he just sits in a goal\r\n        all soccer game, but maybe he can move.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jonah.

Both of these teams have struggled mightily to score\r\n    points, but Aross has been winning while MW has been losing. Lamar and\r\n    Dalvin form a formidable duo, but this writer before Herbert-McCaffrey. We\r\n    find it hard to trust Gaskin, AJB, Allen, and Mike Davis on any given week.\r\n    While both of these teams have been inconsistent at best and this one may\r\n    not top 100 points on either side, we expect a bit of an upset this week,\r\n    and have <em>United Nations by 8.6</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Aross: \u201cDon\u2019t know who I play but good win\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    MW: \u201cJust worried about my team not the opponent\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>I Got a Half Chubb vs Mike Williams WR1: </em></strong>\r\n    Pat Mahomes is back, but will the rest of the team catch up? We\u2019re not sold\r\n    on it. The loss of Cordarelle Patterson has forced Juice Landry back into\r\n    the lineup, and Jeff Wilson Jr\u2019s role should continue to grow in San Fran\r\n    as he returns from injury, hurting Elijah Mitchell\u2019s stock. BMW and Cooks\r\n    are too inconsistent, and Kittle disappeared after the first drive last\r\n    night. The team can compete, but we don\u2019t see it this week. For CJ, Rodgers\r\n    should be back to normal this week with a full week of practice, and gets\r\n    to feast upon a weak Minnesota secondary. Chubb has the best matchup in\r\n    history, RIP DMONT is back, Hopkins and Thielen both get nice ones, and\r\n    Andrews and Diontae have proven somewhat matchup proof. This one shouldn\u2019t\r\n    be close, and we like <em>I Got a Half Chubb by 25.6.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Brad: \u201cGoing to destroy CJ so I make his IG story\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    CJ: \u201cLol I got brad this week\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>GRIDDY GANG vs CalAmari Cooper: </em></strong>\r\n    Jase, I\u2019m sorry. I wish this season had gone differently for you. If Kamara\r\n    plays, then there is an outside shot with the Kamara-Jefferson-McLaurin\r\n    trio. If he doesn\u2019t though Jason has about zero shot. For Dmichs,\r\n    Dak-Taylor-Hollywood-Kelce is proving a tough combo to beat, and should\r\n    continue their high level of play this week. Dmichs has certainly evolved\r\n    into a top-tier contender, and we see no signs of him slowing down this\r\n    week. We like <em>CalAmari Cooper by 32.4.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jase: \u201cWho do I play\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dmichs: \u201cGg Jason you win\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Real Brothers vs Pray for Ridley: </em></strong>\r\n    This is probably the best team Bank has fielded yet (if you think I\u2019m\r\n    kidding, I\u2019m not). Gaining two bellcows via injury, Conner and Dillon lead\r\n    a team with solid WRs and Tom Brady. If Damien Harris can\u2019t play, Rhamondre\r\n    Stevenson is a major problem as well. For Jart, the return of Saquon looms\r\n    large, while Mark Ingram may be in a phenomenal position if Kamara can\u2019t\r\n    play this week. That RB2 spot will be one to watch this week, while the QB\r\n    and TE/WR/FLEX spots are locked in with Hurts-Adams-Hill-Chase-Pitts. The\r\n    talent is certainly higher on Jart\u2019s side, but the production has not yet\r\n    been there consistently to trust it week in week out. Bellcows are the\r\n    safest thing in fantasy, so we like <em>Pray for Ridley by 5.6. </em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jart: \u201cI got a lot of respect for Bank. Injuries have really helped him\r\n    out. Conner+Dillon a scary duo. Boys are gonna have to bring it this week\r\n    if we want to have a chance. Can\u2019t be scoring 70 points again this season\r\n    or else I\u2019m in trouble\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Bank: \u201cJart is still in trouble\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team Horses vs Team ACL Tear: </em></strong>\r\n    One team underperforming with its talent, the other probably\r\n    overperforming. For JL, the health of Kyler continues to be a key question,\r\n    while Ekeler-Mixon-Lamb-Samuel has proven a formidable core. For Folbe, WR\r\n    remains a major question mark as Beta Metcalf, Waddle, and Higgins have yet\r\n    to prove they are reliable options. Perhaps Chris Carson slides into the\r\n    FLEX upon his return, joining Zeke and Fournette in what is a solid RB\r\n    stable. This team is led by Josh Allen, and it should be his play that puts\r\n    this team on top this week. We like <em>Team Horses by 7.6.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Folbe: \u201cJonah\u2019s team is bad just in time for our matchup. How nice of him\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    JL: \u201cI hope my boys play as well as Folbe dances next week\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>NN vs Nooni: </em></strong>\r\n    This is probably the most lopsided matchup of the season, although Stafford\r\n    and Kupp on bye does help some (although it also puts Hendoggy on bye).\r\n    Jakobi is scoring tuddies now though, and Nooni has likely the worst team\r\n    this league has seen. We like <em>NN by 37.6.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    NN: \u201cWho tf is Nooni gonna start at RB1 or RB2\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Nooni:<strong><em> </em></strong>\u201cDon\u2019t know my upcoming matchup don\u2019t\r\n    care. Just want over 100 pts\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Best Player at Each Position</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    QB: Pat Mahomes, Brad\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Nick Chubb, CJ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Stefon Diggs, NN (bad luck to pick one of my guys)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    TE: Kyle Pitts, Jart (good luck to pick one of my guys)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    D/ST: Patriots D/ST, JL (classic)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    K: Fat Randy, FA\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Family Award</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    This week\u2019s award goes to Jason.
