But I would guess no, although the league will\r\n    probably get together and do something, just at a different venue instead.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>What changes are coming to the league next year?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Probably not very many once the rubber hits the road, but I think we will\r\n    see at least some change in how we currently do defenses and kickers.\r\n    Whether that is eliminating them or adjusting scoring again, I think it\r\n    will look different. With kickers this year we managed to eliminate a lot\r\n    of the variance across the league (see the kicker scoring rankings),\r\n    whereas defense left a much bigger gap. So I could see us shrinking the\r\n    range of defensive scoring if we keep defenses. Beyond those two spots, I\r\n    do think we will see a new roster spot this year, whether it be a FLEX or a\r\n    Super FLEX. Tides seem to be moving in that direction, with a regular FLEX\r\n    seeming more likely right now. I would be intrigued by how a tiered PPR\r\n    system may operate (Example: .5 PPR for RBs, .75 for WRs, 1 for TEs), but\r\n    that doesn\u2019t seem likely for this upcoming season. I think we will probably\r\n    end up sticking with a snake format sadly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        How many years does the Jart report see Dan Campbell lasting in\r\n        Detroit?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I think it is wise to consider the roster in Detroit when considering\r\n    Campbell\u2019s longevity. It does not look like we will be drafting a guy we\r\n    want to be the franchise QB this draft, so Campbell shouldn\u2019t be judged off\r\n    next year either. Assuming we get that player heading into Year 3 for\r\n    Campbell (Bryce Young?), he will get 2 years to develop that and see if we\r\n    can get something going. I think we do, and I think Campbell ultimately\r\n    ends up being here around 7 years, leaving the team in better shape than it\r\n    was when he took over. Good, but not elite. Think Caldwell era.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Can Kyler Murray see over his O-Line? </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    No.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        If you had to power rank GMs by roster moves this year how would it\r\n        look?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I will do this more in-depth this offseason so this is just a quick stab\r\n    that I reserve the rights to change in a couple of months, but here are my\r\n    initial thoughts:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        NN\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        JL\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jason\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jart\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Alex\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        CJ\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Brad\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Folbe\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Bank\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        MW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Nooni\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Top three favorite meals?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I am honestly not a huge foodie, I don\u2019t make a ton of elaborate meals, so\r\n    this is gonna be somewhat disappointing in all likelihood:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        Frita Batidos, double beef frita with the garlic cilantro fries and a\r\n        coconut cream batido.

I lean NN in this one as\r\n    the stafford/kupp stack vs Seattle should be a solid edge over the\r\n    Dak/Cooper stack. Jonathan Taylor is a tank but against the pats it could\r\n    be a slow day for him. I like NN in a close one\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -Good luck and don\u2019t take this opportunity for granted\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>NN:</strong>\r\n    EZ clap. Enough of all that nice talking. I\u2019m coming for blood\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Dmichs:</strong>\r\n    Looking forward to a tough matchup with NN, should be a close one\r\n</p>\r\n    <h3>Best Player at Each Position (Playoffs)</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    QB: Matt Stafford, NN\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Nick Chubb, CJ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Cooper Kupp, NN\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    TE: Travis Kelce, Dmichs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    D/ST: Bills D/ST, CJ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    K: Matt Prater, Dmichs\r\n</p>\r\n    <h3>Family Award (Playoffs)</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    For his triumphant first place PF finish to clinch a playoff spot and move\r\n    all the way up to the 4 seed, NN is our Family Award winner this week. The\r\n    boys are humming together, and although they will crash and burn against\r\n    Dmichs this week, at least they made the playoffs.\r\n</p>"}
