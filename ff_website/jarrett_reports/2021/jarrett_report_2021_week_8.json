{"title": "Interregnum", "season": 2021, "week": "8", "report": "<p>\r\n    Welcome back to the Jart Report after a week eight highlighted by a\r\n    devastating injury to the King (interregnum= time span between kings), and\r\n    some surprising results. Despite the poor showing from The Family, we\r\n    remain excited to bring you this week\u2019s analysis.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Week Eight Recap</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    To start, we are going to be looking back at how week eight unfolded versus\r\n    the predictions that the Jart Team put together. The team strives to learn\r\n    from previous weeks to make the most informed predictions, and as we have\r\n    moved into the middle of the season we hope to improve in accuracy\r\n    considerably. We will go matchup by matchup and look at what we learned as\r\n    the season begins to take shape.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team ACL Tear vs Tompa Bay: </em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Prediction: <em>Team ACL Tear by 17.8</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Reality: <em>Team ACL Tear by 9.26</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cGlad to see that my boys can still get it done even with multiple goose\r\n    eggs.

Thanks to my opponent for a great\r\n    matchup\u201d - NN\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cAs head of The Family I did not feel we had much of a chance, and it is\r\n    clear that the kids caught on this week. Was encouraged by the play of\r\n    Hurts, Chase, and Tyreek, but obviously significant progress needs to be\r\n    made. Kyle Pitts was not that ___ this week, but I still have a lot of\r\n    faith in him. I feel great about my roster especially when all are healthy,\r\n    but this week was certainly a sign that we\u2019re not about to cruise the rest\r\n    of the season.

The doubters were of course\r\n    out on my team but the fellas who we started with from day 1 showed up and\r\n    showed glimpses of what I hoped for. We thank Jason for a light sweat of a\r\n    week and wish him the best for his loss of King Henry. Look for us to\r\n    engage in a trade this week.\u201d - Alex\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cMy guys didn't perform plain and simple.

So please ask some in the future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Who is the next top 10 player at their position to head to the IR?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Ignoring guys who are currently nursing some injuries and may easily\r\n    reinjure them (Kyler, Waller, Knox, etc.), I am actually going to go with a\r\n    former Family member here in Cordarelle Patterson. I really hope this is\r\n    not the case as I still have him in my other five leagues, but the amount\r\n    of touches he is getting at his age is a bit of a concern. He was lucky to\r\n    avoid a concussion in London, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he gets hurt\r\n    soon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>When is RIP DMONT coming back?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Good question Squeejadiddlydoo. The Bears have been very vague on his\r\n    status, and I partly wondered if maybe he would get dealt to Tennessee\r\n    given the play of Khalil Herbert. With the Bears having a Week 10 bye, I\r\n    think Week 11 against Baltimore could be a good opportunity, unless they\r\n    decide to wait until Week 12 for a favorable rushing matchup against\r\n    Detroit. Given that Detroit is who he got hurt against though, I think we\r\n    will see him Week 11.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>On To Week Nine!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>This Week\u2019s Matchups</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team ACL Tear vs Team Ross: </em></strong>\r\n    The top two seeds so far this season face off in what should be a fun one.\r\n    Two electric QBs in Lamar and Kyler face off, although neither has been\r\n    quite what their owners had probably fully hoped for when drafting them.\r\n    While JL\u2019s team has seemingly been getting weaker, at least in comparison\r\n    to some budding super teams, there is a lot to like with Murray, Ekeler,\r\n    Lamb, and emerging star Deebo Samuel. There is a reason this team is 8-0\r\n    after all, and it has been the consistency. While not always a lock for\r\n    120+ like MW in 2020, JL is gonna put up competitive numbers every week,\r\n    and so far that has always been enough to win. For Aross, this team has\r\n    certainly garnered a lot of criticism for being 5-3 despite a low PF. There\r\n    are some key guys who have underperformed so far in Dalvin, AJB, and Keenan\r\n    Allen, although the latter two showed signs of righting the ship last week.\r\n    Without Antonio Brown, the FLEX position remains a major concern, as well\r\n    as the inconsistent play of Miles Gaskin. It just simply isn\u2019t good\r\npractice to pick against Jonah currently, so    <em>we like Team ACL Tear by 13.4</em> in a higher-scoring game than some\r\n    may expect.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    JL: \u201cExcited to see who wins the \u2018fraud bowl\u2019 between Aross and I\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Alex: \u201cJL is due. Simple as that. Good win tho Jonah\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Real Brothers vs Dmichs: </em></strong>\r\n    These teams come in off very different week eight narratives, as Jart was\r\n    blown out of the water and Dmichs was betrayed by Travis Kelce on MNF.\r\n    Dmichs surely we will glad to have Hollywood and Jacobs back off bye to\r\n    help round out a lineup that overall had a lower scoring week. Amari Cooper\r\n    looked great with Cooper Rush at the helm, and should continue that into\r\n    this week with Dak presumably back. Hollywood draws a nice matchup with a\r\n    very suspect Minnesota secondary that was just torn up by the\r\n    aforementioned Rush, while Kelce should bounce back nicely in a big time\r\n    game. For Jart, the questions this week begin and end at the RB spot. With\r\n    Swift on bye, Sanders on IR, and Saquon questionable, things could get\r\n    dicey very quickly. While we know The Family trusts Kenyan Drake under new\r\n    coaching, he is far from a sure thing. There is a lot to like of course\r\n    from the WR trio of Chase, Adams, and Tyreek, while Hurts and Pitts should\r\n    increase their production this week. While this is a tough one to predict,\r\n    we expect Saquon to be able to give it a go, and that catalyzes a team with\r\na lot of potential firepower. <em>We like</em>    <em>Real Brothers by 4.4</em> in a barn burner.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dmichs: \u201cExcited for my matchup with Jarrett, always a fun competitor\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jart: \u201cExcited for my matchup with Daniel, always a fun competitor. A lot\r\n    to like about this Dmichs squad. Will be nice to get to see Damien Harris,\r\n    Hollywood, Dallas Goedert and Bosh before the matchup and hear how they\u2019ve\r\n    been doing. All four were on The Family last year and we\u2019re glad they\u2019ve\r\n    stuck together. We\u2019ve got a lot of respect for Dak and JTay. We hope to put\r\n    our best out there this week in a bounceback performance.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>GRIDDY GANG vs $94 for Dwilli REAALLY?: </em></strong>\r\n    These are two teams headed in dramatically different directions. A team who\r\n    two weeks ago was seen as the likely champion, poor performances and a\r\n    likely fantasy-season-ending injury to Derrick Henry has left Jason in an\r\n    extremely difficult situation, while despite some real dumb trades Nooni\r\n    finds himself in the playoffs currently. We expect Jason to pursue a RB in\r\n    free agency this week to replace Henry, and perhaps a QB as well. For\r\n    Nooni, a bye week for Godwin, Evans, and LockettE has this team looking a\r\n    little sus from top to bottom this week. Chuba Hubbard will likely slide\r\n    into FLEX, but there is not a ton of firepower outside of hopeful\r\n    performances from Hendoggy and Khalil Herbert. For Jason, Justin Jefferson\r\n    simply has to get going soon, and a bye for Terry McLaurin offers Parker\r\n    and Mooney a chance to step up. This one could go many different ways, but\r\n    we expect some of Jason\u2019s stars to pick it up this week, and though this\r\none may be on the lower side of scoring,    <em>we like GRIDDY GANG by 7.8.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jase: \u201cWho am I even playing\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Trade King: \u201cW\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>United Nations vs Pray for Ridley: </em></strong>\r\n    There\u2019s a lot that could be said here, but I think this one boils down to\r\n    the status of CMC. With Brady and Hockenson on bye, Bank likely won\u2019t have\r\n    the firepower to match a MW team with McCaffrey, even with the Cards stack.\r\n    Aaron Jones and Robert Woods both have very nice matchups that should\r\n    bolster the lineup as a whole, even if this writer does not have confidence\r\n    in the longevity of the Cards RB stack. If McCaffrey and James Robinson\r\n    both can\u2019t go, an MW team that badly needs a win likely does not have much\r\n    of a shot. Unfortunately, as of Tuesday night, neither seems particularly\r\n    likely to play, and this <em>we like Pray for Ridley by 11.2</em> in a very\r\n    low scoring game.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    MW: \u201cExcited to finally get a win again and have my number 1 pick back\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Bank: \u201cMy matchup against Merrick sucks\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>NN vs I Got a Half Chubb: </em></strong>\r\n    I love this matchup. Stafford-Rodgers highlights what should be a fun one\r\n    from top to bottom, as there are a good number of guys with some volatility\r\n    in both of these lineups. For NN, Najee and Kupp have been the rocks, while\r\n    the ascendance of Michael Carter and return of Clyde Edwards-Helaire will\r\n    be interesting to watch. For CJ, the play of Michael Pittman Jr lately has\r\n    certainly been eye-catching, while Melvin Gordon has continued to fill in\r\n    admirably for RIP DMONT. Red hot Nath certainly has a lot going for him,\r\n    and it\u2019ll be tough to pick against a team that just led the league in PF\r\n    this week. Aaron Rodgers should have a massive outing in a back and forth\r\n    game with the Chiefs, while the Carter-Pittman Jr matchup on TNF brings\r\n    some intriguing early action. With some room for waiver acquisitions, NN\u2019s\r\n    team could show us a new look by tomorrow, but we like its sure-thing\r\n    firepower enough to feel safer picking them this week. We don\u2019t like safe\r\nthough! In one that could definitely go either way,    <em>we like CJ by 3.2, </em>led by Rodgers and Andrews<em>.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    NN: \u201cGood win to my opponent\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    CJ: \u201cI need to take down red hot Nath\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Mike Williams WR1 vs Team Horses: </em></strong>\r\n    If you listen to Brad, he\u2019s winning. And he may be right. Bye weeks for\r\n    Metcalf, Fournette, Gibson, and McKissic take some stars out of this\r\n    matchup, but there is still a lot to like out there. Josh Allen has proven\r\n    his QB1 status from the offseason, while Tee Higgins, Jerry Jeudy, and\r\n    Jaylen Waddle all provide big play opportunities. Ty Johnson is coming off\r\n    a big game while the Jets figure out snap distribution at RB, and should\r\n    see some additional opportunities in a quick week against the Colts. For\r\n    Brad, the struggling Patrick Mahomes is joined by undrafted Elijah Mitchell\r\n    and Cordarelle Patterson, who have both shown their ability to compete with\r\n    the best of em. Few WR trios provide greater boom-bust production than\r\n    BMW-Cooks-Juice, but all have at least decent matchups this week. People\r\nare talking, and they\u2019re liking Brad. But let\u2019s shut them up,    <em>Team Horses by 7.6.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Brad: \u201cNo idea who I\u2019m playing, don\u2019t matter, winning once again.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Folbe:<strong><em> </em></strong>\u201cPeople are talking.
