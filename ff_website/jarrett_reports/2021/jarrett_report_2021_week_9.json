{"title": "What Even Was That", "season": 2021, "week": "9", "report": "<p>\r\n    Welcome back to the Jart Report after a week nine composed of extremely\r\n    weird fantasy performances and low scores across the board. While The\r\n    Family continues to struggle with their second straight 11th PF\r\n    performance, we remain committed to bringing you the best analysis in the\r\n    business.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    Week Nine Recap\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    To start, we are going to be looking back at how week nine unfolded versus\r\n    the predictions that the Jart Team put together. The team strives to learn\r\n    from previous weeks to make the most informed predictions, and as we have\r\n    moved into the middle of the season we hope to improve in accuracy\r\n    considerably. This week was potentially the weirdest week in fantasy\r\n    history though. We will go matchup by matchup and look at what we learned\r\n    as the season begins to take shape.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team ACL Tear vs Team Ross: </em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Prediction: <em>Team ACL Tear by 13.4</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Reality: <em>Team Ross by 7.14</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cAross\u2019 defense is elite\u201d - Lopey\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cJonah was due\u201d - Aross\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Real Brothers vs Dmichs: </em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Prediction: <em>Real Brothers by 4.4</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Reality: <em>Dmichs by 55.2</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cI enjoy sweating my matchups, but Jart deprived me of that this week.\u201d -\r\n    Dmichs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cSaquon?

 <strong>Best Transaction: </strong>\r\n    Jordan Howard, $1, MW. When Boston Scott went for $15, MW picked up the\r\n    true lead back in this offense and got a great value. Of course he was on\r\n    his bench, and Miles Sanders will return, but for now it is a nice pick up.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: Dan Arnold, $0, Brad. Guy is gonna be a problem, he\u2019s\r\n    the Jaguars top receiving threat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Worst Transaction:</strong>\r\n    Jordan Love, $4, Bank. Really not terrible from a fantasy perspective, but\r\n    the dude was awful and deserves to make this list.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: Saints D/ST, $12, Alex. This maybe isn\u2019t the worst\r\n    transaction either, but that\u2019s a lot of money to spend on a defense who\r\n    scored 1 point. I understand the move though, I liked the matchup and Alex\r\n    has FAAB to spend.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    Record by PF Finish\r\n</h3\r\n<p>\r\n    1st: 9-0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2nd: 7-2\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    3rd: 7-2\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    4th: 6-3\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    5th: 7-2\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    6th: 5-4\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    7th: 6-3\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    8th: 4-5\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    9th: 1-8\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    10th: 1-8\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    11th: 1-8\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    12th: 0-9\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Power Rankings</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        JL (8-1)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        CJ (5-4)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs (5-4)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Aross (6-3)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        NN (4-5)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Bank (5-4)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Folbe (5-4)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jason (4-5)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        MW (3-6)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Brad (3-6)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jart (4-5)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Nooni (2-7)\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    No debating.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Worst Possible Lineup</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    QB: Tyrod Taylor, 5.9 points, JL\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Chase Edmonds, 0.3 points, Bank\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Khalil Herbert, 1.3 points, Nooni\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Bryan Edwards, 0 points, Alex\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Jarvis Landry, 2.6 points, Brad<strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    TE: Tommy Sweeney, 2.0 points, Bank\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    FLEX: Ceedee Lamb, 3.3 points, JL\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    D/ST: San Fran D/ST, -2 points, Brad\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    K: Mason Crosby, -1 points, Nooni\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Total Points: 12.4</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWould it have beaten Nooni:    <strong>No. Congrats to NN, Brad, and Jase on not being listed.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Best Possible Lineup</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    QB: Justin Herbert, 31.64 points, MW\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: James Conner, 37.8 points, Bank\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Jonathan Taylor, 33.0 points, Dmichs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Keenan Allen, 16.4 points, Alex\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Marquise Brown, 16.1 points, Dmichs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    TE: George Kittle, 17.1 points, Brad\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    FLEX: Nick Chubb, 29.3 points, CJ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    D/ST: New England, 19.0 points, JL as always\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    K: Michael Badgley, 7.5 points, CJ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Total Points: 207.84 \u2192 will be a typical week for CJ soon</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Would it have beaten Dwitt in 2019: Yessir, we nice</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>League Takes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Agree:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -\u201cAnyone can win this *poop*\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -\u201cI want to win more games\u201d - Jase\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -\u201cJart should be kicked out of the league for how badly he is performing\r\n    with the roster he has\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -\u201cJL will regress towards the mean here soon\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -\u201c2-6 seeds are still wide open!\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -\u201cStill can\u2019t believe how bad Nooni\u2019s team is\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Neutral:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -\u201cI love badussy squirts\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -\u201cInjuries are plaguing us\u201d - CJ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -\u201dFolbe\u2019s roster is bottom 3 in the league\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -\u201cAlex\u2019s team is bad.

(Based on transactions,\r\n        starting the right guys, etc.)\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        NN. While mostly this has been achieved through abusing Nooni, it\u2019s\r\n        paid off. The roster looks nice top to bottom, and although he hasn\u2019t\r\n        been perfect, he claims our top spot.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        CJ. The lack of acquisitions hinders some, but sometimes no\r\n        acquisitions is a good thing. CJ has weathered the storm of Chubb and\r\n        Dmont injuries with solid depth, and is sitting nicely right now. Wentz\r\n        proved a great Rodgers fill-in as well.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jason. He can\u2019t make his guys play well, and his bench depth was\r\n        certainly lacking this year, but he acquired what was the most talented\r\n        starting lineup in league history.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Aross. Propelled primarily through his draft night trade, Aross\r\n        continues to just be solid. Nothing too wild, but he works in calm\r\n        fashion and gets what he needs. Not the flashiest, but effective.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Folbe. When I think of Folbe, I think of Tim Patrick. And how he was\r\n        bad on Folbe\u2019s team and great off of it. But besides that, been pretty\r\n        solid.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs. Really the only notable move here is buying Damien Harris from\r\n        Nooni, but that\u2019s paid off nicely. If it ain\u2019t broke! The draft night\r\n        trade with Alex is what hinders him some.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Bank. Has a knack for WR2s. AJ Dillon a nice pickup, but picking up and\r\n        starting Jordan Love is worthy of being 12th on this list.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jart. I know many of you think I should be last on this list given my\r\n        lineup efficiency standings, but a lot of that has come from waiver\r\n        acquisitions that have proven highly effective. Cordarelle Patterson\r\n        was a number of those weeks, and he turned into Davante Adams. And this\r\n        last week, Aiyuk outscored Tyreek Hill by double digits. Never would\r\n        have played Aiyuk over Hill, Adams, or Chase, but my lineup efficiency\r\n        was impacted by ~12% this week for it.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        JL. Stick with me here. But he had indisputably the best team early on.\r\n        But I think he just got too comfortable with that, realized his lead\r\n        was slipping, and panicked some. These rankings are certainly fluid,\r\n        but I think JL\u2019s team has gotten worse over the season.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        MW. He has had some occasional nice adds, most notably Devontae Booker\r\n        and Pat Friermuth, but not much else has happened. The MW approach\r\n        seems to be to trust the draft and add a solid RB, but the WR depth on\r\n        this team is atrocious.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Brad. $99 for Elijah Mitchell really hasn\u2019t been too bad, but this team\r\n        is struggling and has poor lineup efficiency. Outside of Elijah the\r\n        waiver moves haven\u2019t stuck out, but if Cordarelle continues to\r\n        outperform Davante Adams he\u2019ll get a bump.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Nooni. We all know why (plus $94 on Damien Williams).\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Is this the most competitive season in league history?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I think to date, this has been the most competitive season. Everyone is\r\n    really in the thick of it and no one has separated themselves yet in terms\r\n    of having the record and the team to back it up. However, in the long term\r\n    I do not think this season will end up that way. The formation of some\r\n    elite rosters cannot be ignored, and at some point one would expect those\r\n    rosters to perform. Unlike the past couple of years, this seems like a year\r\n    where a team with an elite roster that has not quite gotten the wins sneaks\r\n    into the playoffs and then dominates the teams with byes. So, if that\r\n    sounds competitive to you, then yes! But if that sounds like hidden\r\n    separation because of injuries and poor performances that have impacted\r\n    records and scores, then no.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        How far could nooni have gone had he not traded away all of his great\r\n        players?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    While the Jart Report was busy praying on his downfall, Nooni had been\r\n    putting together quite the team. If we look back to Week 7, when he had\r\n    129.26 points, the core of Stafford, Hendoggy, Carter, Evans, Godwin,\r\n    Gesicki, and LockettE truly had the potential to compete with anyone. This\r\n    was a team racing up the roto boards, and we liked them to appear in the\r\n    semi-finals at worst, if not a trip to the finals. Now, not so much. No\r\n    shot he makes the playoffs, unless something dramatic happens.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Can you rank the order of league members who spend the most time on\r\n        fantasy football app or website?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jart, primarily in formulating the Jart Report every week\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Folbe, although likely less now that the beautiful website is up and\r\n        running\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Noah, gotta be on there often to make as many transactions as he does\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs, guy just seems like he loves to stare at his team\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        JL, at this point mostly just looking back to weeks 1-6 and reminiscing\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Nooni, balance of his ignorant trades made but also constant name\r\n        changes\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Alex, don\u2019t always hear from him a ton but you know he\u2019s patrolling the\r\n        waivers\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Brad, figuring out what RB he can spend $99 on next year\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Bank, trying to find a 6th WR2 to add to his collection\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        CJ, no time on those weekdays when he\u2019s grinding sales\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jason, for a couple weeks I think he was too discouraged to open the\r\n        app\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        MW, easily\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>On To Week Nine!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>This Week\u2019s Matchups:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team ACL Tear vs United Nations: </em></strong>\r\n    While on paper, one of the top teams facing one the bottom doesn\u2019t seem to\r\n    provide much intrigue, there is a lot more here than initially meets the\r\n    eye record wise. JL is certainly struggling to find offensive firepower\r\n    currently, while MW looks to build off McCaffrey\u2019s return and potentially\r\n    James Robinson as well. For JL, QB is certainly a question this week, along\r\n    with the RB2 spot as Merrick Bank\u2019s personal hero and icon Joe Mixon is on\r\n    bye. Deebo saw much of his dominant role given to Aiyuk and Kittle this\r\n    last week as well, leaving an 8-1 with a lot more questions than answers.\r\n    For MW, the big question mark is the WR position. With Darnold slumping -\r\n    to put it kindly - and Claypool being the 3rd guy at best in Pittsburgh,\r\n    this team doesn\u2019t have many options at the spot. RB looks good though with\r\n    potentially four options at least in the short term, and Herbert and Waller\r\n    are primed for a big day. We just feel more confident taking the team with\r\n    less question marks this week, and we like <em>MW by 11.7</em> even in a\r\n    bounceback week from Ceedee Lamb.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    JL: \u201cAlways exciting to go against a fellow league champion. MW\u2019s team\r\n    worries me\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    MW: \u201cToo busy to comment\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Real Brothers vs Mike Williams WR1: </em></strong>\r\n    These teams both suck currently. For Brad, it\u2019s been Mahomes, RB2, and the\r\n    WRs. For Jart, it\u2019s been RB injuries and the poor play from the big-3 WR\r\n    corps. There really is not much to say here because there is a lot of\r\n    talent on the field that currently just isn\u2019t producing. The best we can do\r\n    is guess at who will perform best, and the proven firepower at least\r\n    throughout their careers falls on Jart\u2019s side with Tyreek Hill and Davante\r\n    Adams. D\u2019Andre Swift will certainly be a welcome sight for a hurting Family\r\n    backfield, and Brandon Aiyuk has a chance to build off of last week with\r\n    Ja\u2019Marr Chase on bye. Cordarelle-Davante will be the fun matchup of the\r\n    week given that they were traded for each other. We expect Rodgers to play,\r\nand with some nicer performances from the star WRs, we like    <em>Real Brothers by 12.2</em> in a much needed win.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Brad: \u201cGoing to absolutely boat race team Jarrett, starting with Baltimore\r\n    defense getting 15 thurs.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jart: \u201cGoing to get absolutely boat raced by Brad, starting with Baltimore\r\n    defense getting 15 thurs.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>GRIDDY GANG vs NN: </em></strong>\r\n    We\u2019re calling this one the Nooni bowl given how many of these players\r\n    (especially the stars) have been rostered by Nooni this year. Despite last\r\n    week\u2019s results, these are two teams that continue to trend in very\r\n    different directions. The play of Najee and Kupp along with Nooni handing\r\n    NN every good player he\u2019s ever thought about having has NN riding high,\r\n    while Jason continues to search for answers from his WRs and an RB2 to\r\n    replace some of the King\u2019s production. Russell Wilson returns this week,\r\n    and perhaps that will provide a spark for Jason who won last week but in\r\n    rather unimpressive fashion. Kamara, Jefferson, and McLaurin all have nice\r\n    matchups, while Beasley will likely need to get his early in what looks to\r\n    be a blowout against the Jets. For NN, Najee may score 90 points this week,\r\n    and Michael Carter seems primed for heavy passing usage, while Kupp should\r\n    shine on MNF. Diggs similarly will need to get his early on, and Darrel\r\n    should continue to benefit from CEH\u2019s absence. We could see this one going\r\n    either way and expect a solid number of points in this one, but given their\r\nperformances lately, we feel safer taking Noah. We like    <em>NN by 16.5. </em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jase: \u201cGood win NN\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    NN: \u201cGood dub jase\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team Horses vs Pray for Ridley: </em></strong>\r\n    The QBs in this matchup are projected to combine to score 52.64 points,\r\n    which may be the most the Jart Report team has ever seen. Beyond the signal\r\n    callers, there is still a lot to like about both of these teams, as Aaron\r\n    Jones has shown he can score, albeit somewhat inconsistently, and Conner\r\n    should be able to get some carries this week even if Eno is bellcowing. The\r\n    WRs are certainly a question for Bank, as the team has 5 WR2s who really\r\n    can give you 15 or 5 depending on how they\u2019re feeling. Some solid matchups\r\n    this week though gives reason for hope, and Hockenson should have a nice\r\n    day coming out of the bye. For Folbe, Zeke should bounceback along with the\r\n    rest of the Cowboys, while Leonard, DK, Jeudy, and Waddle all draw nice\r\n    matchups. This one feels like it will come down to the matchups, and we\r\n    love what Folbe has this week. So we like <em>Team Horses by 6.6</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Folbe: \u201cRumor has it Merrick is still scarred from last years playoff\r\n    blowout.

There\u2019s a lot that could be\r\n    said here, but we expect both teams to perform well. Ultimately, what we\r\n    see as being the difference maker here is the potential absence of Nick\r\n    Chubb due to a positive COVID test result. If Chubb can go, we like CJ to\r\n    win, if he can\u2019t, we like Dmichs.
