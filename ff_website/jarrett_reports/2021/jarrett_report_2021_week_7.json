Coming\r\n    off a top PF week and a much needed dub, we at the Jart Report are excited\r\n    to dive into what was a fun Week Seven, that the team mostly missed while\r\n    ushering in a wedding.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Week Seven Recap</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    To start, we are going to be looking back at how week seven unfolded versus\r\n    the predictions that the Jart Team put together. The team strives to learn\r\n    from previous weeks to make the most informed predictions, and as we have\r\n    moved into the middle of the season we hope to improve in accuracy\r\n    considerably. We will go matchup by matchup and look at what we learned as\r\n    the season begins to take shape.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team Ross vs Tompa Bay</em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Prediction: Tompa Bay by 32.7\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Reality: Tompa Bay by 15.96\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cI like Merrick Bank\u201d - \u201cAross\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cStory of the week was the 29 pt difference between the two defenses\u201d -\r\n    Bank\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team ACL Tear vs Mike Williams WR1</em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Prediction: Mike Williams WR1 by 12.2\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Reality: Team ACL Tear by 23.4\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cIncredibly embarrassing.

</strong>\r\n    CJ Uzomah, JL, $2. There are no words at this point.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: Kenyan Drake, Jart, $3. It looks like the new regime\r\n    likes Kenyan a lot more, as he got 17 touches last game, and now has 15+\r\n    points in back to back weeks for a Jart team that badly needs RB depth.\r\n    Plus it\u2019s Kenyan!!!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Worst Transaction:</strong>\r\n    Jets D/ST, Aross, $2. They had -11. That\u2019s all.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: Broncos D/ST, NN, $9. A lot to pay for a defense that\r\n    only got 3 points.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Special Segment: Trade Jartalyzer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    JL: Joe Mixon, Marvin Jones Jr (Grade: C+)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    NN: Stefon Diggs, Darrel Williams, Clyde Edwards-Helaire (Grade: B)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    While there are a couple high-profile names here, this trade feels somewhat\r\n    meh overall. Mixon is not good, MJJ is sporadic, Darrel and CEH likely end\r\n    up splitting carries and making both not viable starters, and Diggs doesn\u2019t\r\n    command the same target share anymore.

So please ask some in the future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Why Am I the Worst League Member?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Good question, Aross. You\u2019re the worst league member because you didn\u2019t\r\n    submit any thoughts on your matchups or the league, or ask any questions.\r\n    But we still love you and hope to hear from you next week!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Are the people still talking about Team Silverman?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    They are quite often still, but they are not good things. It seems that\r\n    overall people view Brad as being at the bottom of the league now, a spot\r\n    that for many weeks was occupied by NN but is now a battle between Brad and\r\n    MW (#FreeNooni). I think he\u2019s got some solid pieces that could help turn\r\n    things around (Tyrod Taylor\u2019s return will be big for Cooks), but getting\r\n    some guys healthy will be the vital first step.\r\n    Mahomes-Gibson-Hunt-BMW-Cooks-Kittle-Cordy is a lineup that I can get\r\n    behind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Is Saq coming back soon?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I don\u2019t think this question was asked with the intention of it being in\r\n    Jart\u2019s Mailbag, but it is now! I have read some reports that he is to\r\n    return to practice tomorrow and is planning to play on MNF (why they never\r\n    put him on IR at the time of injury), but I still get the nagging feeling\r\n    he will not return against next week against Vegas (especially with their\r\n    bye the week following).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>What\u2019s the deal with Snead??</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A very timely question, Snead was just released from the Ravens and is now\r\n    a free man. In the immediate future Green Bay obviously makes sense, but I\r\n    would not be surprised to see him end up somewhere like Vegas, Philly, New\r\n    England, Cleveland, or Houston.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>On To Week Eight!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>This Week\u2019s Matchups</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team ACL Tear vs Tompa Bay: </em></strong>\r\n    JL\u2019s boys are back, but despite that this one is actually shaping up to be\r\n    pretty entertaining. Even if their owners don\u2019t believe so, Stefon Diggs\u2019\r\n    absence is quite noticeable, as Emmanuel Sanders likely will not bring the\r\n    same level of production. New England seems like a worthy candidate to hone\r\n    in on shutting down a guy like Ekeler, and Mixon may found himself out of\r\n    the script quickly similar to last week. For Bank, the move away from the\r\n    Cardinals stack is certainly a welcome sight. Ridley is still searching for\r\n    a breakout game as WR1 with Julio in Tennessee, while Devonta Smith steps\r\n    into the starting lineup in an extremely favorable matchup with Detroit.\r\n    TNF will be a big one for this matchup, but we are not in the business of\r\n    betting against JL this week. <em>Team ACL Tear by 17.8.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    JL: \u201cMy boys are back from a well deserved week off. Pray for Bank\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Bank: \u201cit was fun being over .500. Good dub for Jonah\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Real Brothers vs NN: </em></strong>\r\n    Two of the hotter teams in the league lately due to some timely\r\n    acquisitions, this matchup should still bring the fireworks even with Jart\r\n    not at full strength. While NN\u2019s choice at QB will be interesting to watch,\r\n    the WRs certainly catch the eye in this one. Even without Davante Adams,\r\n    there is a lot of high scoring potential, as 3 of the top 4 WRs on the\r\n    season are still facing off in this matchup. The health of Tyreek Hill\u2019s\r\n    quad will certainly be a big factor, as he has looked much less explosive\r\n    the past two weeks. For NN, QB play, Darrel Williams, Jared Cook, and\r\n    Courtland Sutton will be the ones to watch as they provide the greatest\r\n    volatility. For Jart, it\u2019ll be the Pitts, RB2, and FLEX once those are\r\n    figured out. With so many health question marks on Jart\u2019s side, we like NN\r\nto keep his momentum going and pick up another big win. We like    <em>NN by 12.6.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    NN: \u201cBOL and stay healthy in practice this week. We\u2019re looking forward to a\r\n    good, clean match\u201d **Update: Davante Adams did not stay healthy**\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jart: \u201cIt\u2019s an honor and a privilege to be gracing the same field as my\r\n    brother NN. I am sad to not be fielding my full lineup this week due to\r\n    injuries and COVID, but this week will really put to the test if Kyle Pitts\r\n    is indeed that ____\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>GRIDDY GANG vs Team Ross: </em></strong>\r\n    If Jase figures out the QB situation (and we expect he will) he has a top 3\r\n    team no doubt. Justin Jefferson returns in what is a big game for both\r\n    teams. Jase has lost two in a row with some concerning performances from\r\n    those not named Derrick Henry or Alvin Kamara, while Aross\u2019 lack of scoring\r\n    is beginning to catch up with him. While the removal of Mike Davis from the\r\n    lineup is certainly a welcome sight, we just see too much firepower on\r\nJase\u2019s side in this one. While we are ready to be surprised, we like    <em>GRIDDY GANG by 17.4</em> in this one.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jase: \u201cWe\u2019re on to Aross\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cAlex\u201d: \u201cI like Jason Silverstone\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>United Nations vs Mike Williams WR1: </em></strong>\r\n    Oof. The good news is that one of these teams will get a win, something\r\n    that has been quite difficult lately. The bad news is that one of these\r\n    teams will rack up another loss as their season begins to unravel. The\r\n    health of Pat Mahomes is the headliner here, but there is a ton of\r\n    volatility in Brad\u2019s lineup from top to bottom that truly does make it\r\n    difficult to predict. In looking at the matchups though, we do expect a\r\n    better week from Brad. For MW, if Saquon plays the team will be scrambling\r\n    for a FLEX, although perhaps the expected return of Michael Thomas will\r\n    provide a key spark. Overall, we do not love either of these teams for\r\nobvious reasons, but like the ceiling for Brad better. We like    <em>Mike Williams WR1 by 7.8.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    MW: \u201cGoing to be another grind, but confident we can get things rolling\r\n    soon. Glad we have a cake walk team like Brad this week\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBrad: \u201cI am winning this week, and finishing first overall in ROTO\u201d    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        <em>Can\u2019t Keep Up With His Name Changes vs I Got a Half Chubb: </em>\r\n    </strong>\r\n    Lately we have been in the habit of picking CJ to lose and he proves us\r\n    wrong, and we may just be continuing that this week. Nick Chubb\u2019s probable\r\n    return is certainly a welcome sight for a team that had insane RB touchdown\r\n    luck last week, but top-tier TE Mark Andrews will certainly be missed. We\r\n    like the trio of Hopkins-Thielen-Johnson, but they have all been a little\r\n    unpredictable at times. For Nooni, there really is a lot to like despite\r\n    the 1-6 record. Matt Stafford is playing like a top 3 fantasy QB currently,\r\n    Chuba and Darrell should both bounce back this week in very favorable\r\n    matchups, and Evans and Godwin showed their connections with Brady. The\r\n    X-Factor here is the play of Gesicki and Gainwell, and we like both of them\r\n    this week. While at this point Roto may matter more than wins and losses\r\n    for Nooni, we still like <em>$94 for Dwilli REAALLY? by 13.4.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Nooni: \u201cI don\u2019t like most PA not fun\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    CJ: \u201cNext week I got some tough decisions to make with my receivers. And\r\n    I\u2019m gonna beat the *poop* outta Danny\u201d (this is a family-friendly report)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Dmichs vs Team Horses: </em></strong>\r\n    My favorite matchup of the week, this one could easily be in the 150s or\r\n    the 80s based on how these teams have played so far. Jerry Jeudy returning\r\n    for Folbe is certainly encouraging for the long term, but he may not crack\r\n    the lineup this week as Folbe has a plethora of solid options to plug in\r\n    this week. Led by Josh Allen, Horses has certainly faced some ups and downs\r\n    this season, but lately have been sparked by the play of running back\r\n    Leonard \ud83e\udd45 \ud83e\udd45 \ud83e\udd45 \ud83e\udd45. DK has looked a little boom or bust with Geno Smith\r\n    playing QB, while Tee Higgins has certainly taken a back seat to Ja\u2019Marr\r\n    Chase in the Bengals offense. For Dmichs, Jonathan Taylor and Damien Harris\r\n    have been on fire lately, but a bye week for Hollywood Brown caps the\r\n    ceiling some with Corey Davis sliding into the lineup. In what might be a\r\nshakier week than it has been lately for these teams, we like    <em>Team Horses by 3.7 </em>in what should be a fun one to track.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dmichs: \u201cLooking forward to putting the horse back in the stable next\r\n    week.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Folbe:<strong><em> </em></strong>\u201cNoah\u2019s loft might be sick, but his\r\n    fantasy team blows.
