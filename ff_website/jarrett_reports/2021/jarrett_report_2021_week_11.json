Right now, the easy answer is Ja\u2019Marr\r\n    Chase. While Saquon has yet to establish himself he has a couple weeks to\r\n    prove it to me, whereas I am currently quite worried about Ja\u2019Marr. Since\r\n    his 30.1 point game, he has had 11.6, 5.8, and 11.5, without topping 50\r\n    yards receiving in any of those games. While he likely is not headed to the\r\n    bench soon (although Aiyuk may press that issue), he certainly needs a big\r\n    game if he wants to stay in the starting lineup moving forward.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>What is your projected playoff bracket?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jonah\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        CJ\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jart\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Aross\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        NN\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who sucks worse?

There are probably a fair amount of\r\n    candidates, but I am left unable to decide between Bank and Nooni. For\r\n    Bank, Ridley-Woods-Julio wasn\u2019t working out even before all three have\r\n    dealt with matters that have kept them off of the field. Aaron Jones was\r\n    alright when healthy, but better backs went shortly after him. Not every\r\n    pick was bad by any means, but only James Conner really stands out as a\r\n    real good pick. For Nooni, only having one Top-26 pick certainly was a\r\n    hindrance, but Allen Robinson was discussed last week as the biggest bust\r\n    of the draft, and LockettE has certainly had his struggles as well. There\r\n    aren\u2019t too many redeeming qualities to the draft, outside of Gesicki,\r\n    Stafford, and Chuba in the wake of McCaffrey\u2019s injury.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Seems like at least 2.

He has said in the past that he doesn\u2019t have the time to keep\r\n    up with it all, and hey that\u2019s fair, but don\u2019t make your decisions in the\r\n    dark then. Talk to someone else who is at least relatively impartial, and\r\n    make sure that the decisions are the right ones. He had assembled a team to\r\n    compete this year so the pieces can certainly be there for him, but he\r\n    can\u2019t let it all fall apart because of distance from the day-to-day of\r\n    fantasy life and scrambling to make moves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Worst NFL Draft First Round Pick of the Last Decade?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This was a tough one, so I went year by year for the last ten. I get\r\n    thoughts of guys like Rashaad Penny, but the value between an early first\r\n    round pick and late first round is so monumental that I really only focused\r\n    on top 12 picks.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2012: Justin Blackmon, WR\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2013: Luke Joeckel, OT\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2014: Greg Robinson, OT\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2015: Kevin White, WR\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2016: Eli Apple, CB\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2017: Solomon Thomas, DE\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2018: Josh Rosen, QB\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2019: Clelin Ferrell, DE\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2020: Jeff Okudah, CB\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2021: Jaycee Horn, CB\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Of these ten, my choice is probably Kevin White. Because he has 323 yards\r\n    receiving in his entire career, and was the 7th overall pick. LockettE\r\n    (69th), Jamison Crowder (105th), and Stefon Diggs (146th) are the only\r\n    notable WRs from this class, but White never was healthy. I\u2019d understand\r\n    picking any of these guys besides probably Okudah or Horn since they\u2019re so\r\n    young. Surtain going right after Horn is an additional big knock on his\r\n    selection.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Which kicker should I pick up this week?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A lot of good options out there on the waivers this week, but if I had to\r\n    choose one it would be Evan McPherson. A solid kicker all year in what\r\n    should be a high scoring matchup.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Future of the Jart report in the off-season.

So whoever finishes last this year will be written about first,\r\n    and whoever wins the league will be last. So expect some sort of facetime\r\n    interview, etc. as I get into each one. I would imagine there will be about\r\n    2 a month spread out across the offseason, so make sure to keep some of\r\n    your thoughts and whatnot from the course of the season available for when\r\n    I come knocking.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>On To Week Twelve!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>This Week\u2019s Matchups:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team Ross vs NN: </em></strong>\r\n    This is probably the most intriguing matchup of the week to me, because\r\n    they are two teams that both seem to need wins for different reasons. For\r\n    Aross, the first round bye is certainly up for grabs right now with a\r\n    number of teams only a game back, while for NN the roto hit this last week\r\n    increases the need to get some wins and looking good while doing it. The\r\n    loss of Michael Carter is certainly notable, while KC\u2019s bye leaves Pollard\r\n    and Meyers in the starting lineup. While I expect some waiver moves to be\r\n    made, the combo of Stafford-Najee-Kupp-Diggs looks to be lethal this week.\r\n    For Aross, Lamar looks like he will be back this week, and will be joined\r\n    by Dalvin, Keenan, and a number of guys who have been somewhat inconsistent\r\n    this year, although David Johnson could provide some valuable production at\r\n    the FLEX. This is one that could definitely go either way, but I think\r\n    Stafford-Kupp is too much to overcome in what should be a shootout with\r\n    Green Bay. For this reason, we like <em>NN by 9.3</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Aross: \u201cBOL NN good win bro\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    NN: \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, season is over\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>I Got a Half Chubb vs Pray for Ridley: </em></strong>\r\n    With heart and soul of the team James Conner on bye, there is not a ton\r\n    here to love. As of right now it is Brady, Dillon, and a lot of average\r\n    guys. For CJ, the return of Chubb and DMont coupled with the emergence of\r\n    Michael Pittman has this team looking quite dangerous. While it may not\r\n    have the elite of the elite at any position, there are no real weaknesses\r\n    on this team, and it is certainly a better roster than Bank has right now.\r\n    We like <em>I Got a Half Chubb by 21.3</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Bank: \u201cI suck\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    CJ: \u201cTake it the \ud83c\udfe6 this week\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Nooni vs CalAmari Cooper: </em></strong>\r\n    Nooni is coming of an 11th place PF win, while Dmichs looks to bounce back\r\n    from a tough loss to Jason. Until Nooni scores above 80, I am not going to\r\n    pick him. Too much firepower on Dmichs\u2019 side in what should be a solid\r\n    bounceback game for Dak. We like <em>CalAmari Cooper by 27.6</em>.<em></em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Nooni: \u201cI\u2019m going to find a way to win here\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dmichs: \u201cNooni is no fun to play against, too much of a gimme\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Real Brothers vs Team ACL Tear: </em></strong>\r\n    A potential preview of a playoff matchup, both teams come in off solid wins\r\n    and are looking good. For JL, Ekeler-Mixon-Deebo is proving dangerous every\r\n    single week, and the return of Gronk has pairs well with the emergence of\r\n    Cam Newton. For Jart, No Tyreek Hill this week means either Ingram, Aiyuk,\r\n    or Sanders is getting the start at FLEX this week. Both teams have a ton of\r\n    firepower, but JL has shown much greater consistency every week, and for\r\n    that reason we like <em>Team ACL Tear by 17.6</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jart: \u201cCould see these teams combining for 300 points, or I could put up\r\n    70. Who knows. A lot of respect for what JL has done this year, excited to\r\n    get to matchup again after a disappointing loss in Week One because I\r\n    benched D\u2019Andre Swift since he wasn\u2019t starting\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    JL: \u201cExcited to go against the best this week although I don\u2019t expect much\r\n    with Kyler and \ud83d\udcbf out. Happy to give jart a win now so I can beat him in the\r\n    finals\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team Horses vs United Nations: </em></strong>\r\n    Two teams trending in different directions currently, MW picked up a much\r\n    needed win while Folbe continues to struggle to put up points. While the\r\n    ceiling on MW\u2019s team does seem pretty evident, Herbert-Caff-Jrob-Waller is\r\n    a nice combo, and Javonte Williams should continue to improve down the\r\n    stretch this season. For Folbe, Allen-Zeke-Fournette is a great combo, but\r\n    the WR play has been inconsistent and disappointing to this point. There\u2019s\r\n    a lot to like from Metcalf-Waddle-Higgins-Jeudy, but they need to prove\r\n    they can do it every week. Until that happens, we trust the consistency of\r\n    MW\u2019s stars, and we like <em>United Nations by 3.6</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Folbe: \u201cIdk who I play but I hope they can\u2019t score more than 85 because\r\n    that\u2019s all I got\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    MW: \u201cNever seen a more perfect lineup but unsure what to do about Koo\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>GRIDDY GANG vs Mike Williams WR1: </em></strong>\r\n    Like Trey Sermon, you can\u2019t let Jase get hot. He got hot last week.\r\n    Although Tyrod Taylor is certainly an upgrade over Pat Mahomes, Rex is a\r\n    lock for 30, the WRs are cooking now, and GRIDDY GANG is just too much\r\n    right now. We like <em>GRIDDY GANG by 62.5</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Brad: \u201cI\u2019m officially in tank mode I hope I lose to Jase\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jase:<strong><em> </em></strong>\u201cThank god I'm playing Brad\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Best Player at Each Position</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    QB: Josh Allen, Folbe\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Christian McCaffrey, MW\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Cooper Kupp, NN\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    TE: Mark Andrews, CJ\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    D/ST: Whoever JL starts\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    K: Evan McPherson, FA\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Family Award</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    In honor of a big win last week, we are giving MW the Family award for\r\n    staying true to McCaffrey and waiting on his return instead of moving him\r\n    even in the midst of losses. Team looks solid, and the commitment to the\r\n    players has paid off.\r\n</p>"}
