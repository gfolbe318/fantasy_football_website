I think yes.\r\n    In some ways I\u2019d like to think I pioneered some of that shift this year,\r\n    trading down from 3 to 11 to get the guy I wanted and a slew of other draft\r\n    assets (that turned into Tyreek Hill and Brandin Cooks). There is still a\r\n    high value on these spots, as anyone who can consistently get you 20+ at RB\r\n    (like Taylor, Ekeler, and Mixon have been) is insanely valuable. In many\r\n    ways these RB injuries have highlighted just how important the position is,\r\n    because it can get really thin really fast. I still expect these to be the\r\n    first four spots chosen next year.<strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>CFP predictions?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Georgia 27, Michigan 17. I think Michigan struggles to run against\r\n    Georgia\u2019s front 7, and while they hit some pass plays, it\u2019s not enough. I\r\n    expect to see some JT Daniels as well.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Alabama 35, Cincinnati 20. Alabama looked unbeatable last week, and there\r\n    is just too much talent for pretty much any team in the country to keep up.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Georgia 34, Alabama 27. Georgia gets their revenge, Go Dawgs. No Metchie\r\n    presents too big of an issue for Alabama, as Georgia plays better in the\r\n    secondary and keys on Jameson Williams.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>How did it feel rooting for Michigan?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Phenomenal question. Really weird. Multiple times I found myself\r\n    celebrating a good Iowa play and then having to remind myself that I was\r\n    rooting for Michigan. By the end though it was easy to root for them to\r\n    pour it on and embarrass an Iowa team that had no right being in that game.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>What is your projected playoff bracket?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jonah\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Alex\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        CJ\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        NN\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jart\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>What round does Allen Robinson go next year?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Considering that Justin Fields is the expected QB for the Bears next\r\n    season, if Allen Robinson remains on the Bears, I would expect 4/5th Rd,\r\n    given his upside and that Fields should make a jump heading into his second\r\n    season. If Robinson goes elsewhere, it\u2019ll be incredibly dependent on the QB\r\n    and the WR room he is entering into. He still has the tools to be an elite\r\n    WR, so I think anywhere between the 2nd and 10th rounds based on landing\r\n    spot.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who is everyone\u2019s #1 family member?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        Alex: Lamar Jackson\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Brad: BMW\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs: Dak Prescott\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Folbe: Derrick Henry (doesn\u2019t even matter that he\u2019s not on his team)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        CJ: Nick Chubb\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        JL: Joe Mixon\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        NN: Najee Harris\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jason: Justin Jefferson\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Nooni: Tyler LockettE\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jart: Miles Sanders\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Bank: Hunter Renfrow\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        MW: James Robinson\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Who is your sleeper league winner player this year (an unexpected\r\n        player that will put up numbers weeks 15-17 and propel his team to\r\n        fantasy glory)?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    It is going to be extremely tough to beat Jonah this year, and so whoever\r\n    it is needs immense firepower to be able to pull it off.

I don\u2019t know why Nooni trades away his best\r\n    players. I don\u2019t know why Lopey tries to tell us he is going to lose Week\r\n    16. I don\u2019t know why the committee wants Alabama and Georgia to play in the\r\n    natty every year. I don\u2019t know why CJ\u2019s team name is still Henry Ruggs. I\r\n    just don\u2019t know why.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Jart\u2019s Mailbag Pt 2: Revenge of the Bag</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>How good is Aross\u2019 team when healthy?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The most likely lineup in that scenario is:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    QB: Lamar Jackson\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Dalvin Cook, Aaron Jones\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Tee Higgins, DK Metcalf\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    FLEX: AJ Brown\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The weakness here is obviously the WRs, but overall this is probably a\r\n    borderline top 5 lineup. A lot of boom or bust guys that could give Aross a\r\n    legit shot to win the league, or get him embarrassed in the semis. Looks\r\n    better than it did before the trades though.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        We\u2019re in a show for this week, will Nooni sneak into the playoffs?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    MW clearly knows about as much about playoff possibilities as he does half\r\n    his roster. Through no one\u2019s fault but his own, Nooni is eliminated from\r\n    playoff contention.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>How did your finals go?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Good! Did well enough, enjoyed learning a lot, and now we chillin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>What\u2019s the next big penny stock?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Rashaad. But if we are talking non-fantasy football investing, I\u2019ve been a\r\n    little out of the game the last 6 months, but I do still really like the\r\n    long term projections for $CTXR into 2022. I have a real nice profit on it\r\n    already so am just holding.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Who does Jart believe will play in and eventually win this years super\r\n        bowl?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The AFC is such a cluster*frick* that I\u2019m just gonna bet on the Chiefs\r\n    coming out of there because they seem to be figuring it out now, even if\r\n    they refuse to use Tyreek and Kelce and Mahomes plays like Jared Goof now.\r\n    For the NFC, GB will obviously lose by 40 in the NFC Championship game, and\r\n    I think that will be to the Buccaneers, because look I\u2019m not gonna pick\r\n    against Brady. So Chiefs-Bucs rematch, but Patty wins this one and\r\n    relaunches his GOAT campaign despite a rough season.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who\u2019s gonna show the most heart this week? \u2764\ufe0f</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Unsure if this meant what player or what team, so I will do both. For\r\n    player, I like Joe Burrow. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll do that well fantasy wise,\r\n    but that dude dislocated his finger in a tough loss last week, but he\u2019s\r\n    going right back out there this week looking for dubs. I respect it a lot\r\n    if nothing else. For team, give me Alex\u2019s. All year they\u2019ve been hearing\r\n    the noise, they\u2019ve got some fresh blood in there, and they can go grab that\r\n    first round bye to silence the noise.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Which player is the MVP for all of our teams?

While we won\u2019t\r\n    quite know what Saquon\u2019s injury meant coming off a 27 point game, we do\r\n    know what Henry\u2019s injury meant. Especially when you consider what the\r\n    make-up of Jase\u2019s squad was and how much JJeffs has come on while Kamara\r\n    returns from injury, Jason would be the favorite to win the league right\r\n    now had Derrick not gotten injured.<strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        What were some of your favorite places to eat in Ann Arbor?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Frita Batidos is the undisputed GOAT, and I will go there any time I\u2019m\r\n    back. No Thai is a strong #2 for me, and I had it twice when I came home. I\r\n    love bubble tea if that counts, and the new place where Bubble Island used\r\n    to be is also quite good. I worked at Pieology for a summer, and even\r\n    though it\u2019s closed now, I have some great food memories from that time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Favorite memory of Demaryius Thomas?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I mean the Tebow-Thomas OT winner is an all-timer, but I think what I\r\n    always loved most was that Demaryius Thomas and Calvin Johnson, two\r\n    prolific NFL receivers, both went to school at Georgia Tech, a school that\r\n    only runs the ball.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Should we move to auction draft or keep snake draft?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Well I believe it is well known what a large proponent of the auction draft\r\n    that I am, so I will take this opportunity to make my case. We are 11\r\n    players that are locked in all year round to football (+ Nooni) and we know\r\n    what players we like and why we like em. Over this time we\u2019ve developed\r\n    relationships with our players and have come to love them. Think of a guy\r\n    like Folbe who wanted nothing more than for Derrick Henry to be on his\r\n    team, but he didn\u2019t do well enough in a basketball tournament to get a\r\n    football player? That just doesn\u2019t make sense. The auction format allows us\r\n    to put more stake in our drafts. We won\u2019t be able to look back and say \u201coh\r\n    well they just happened to have the __ overall pick and so those players\r\n    fell into their lap\u201d, like it did for MW the two years previous to this one\r\n    with his First Round RB. With auction, it\u2019s on you. Do your homework, get\r\n    ready to play in a league that is absolutely elite. Auction is a needed\r\n    next step for us to continue our evolution into the top 0.01% of leagues.\r\n    Snake is stone age.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>On To Week Fourteen!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>The Scenarios:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Jonah:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Locked into the 1 seed and first round bye.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Alex:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a win, 2 seed locked in and first round bye.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a loss, a loss by CJ, Folbe, or NN clinches a playoff spot still.

Alex is currently 6\r\n    points behind the current 6 seed leader.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>CJ:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a win, playoffs guaranteed anywhere between the 2-4 seed (Dmichs\r\n    trails by 20 PF currently).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a loss, still a lock for the playoffs based on every calculation I can\r\n    make, anywhere between the 3 and 6 seed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Dmichs:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Same exact scenario as CJ, except a win guarantees 2 or 3 seed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>NN:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a win, playoffs guaranteed, anywhere between the 3 and 5 seed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a loss, out unless Jart beats Folbe, but both score less than Noah (or\r\n    Jart scores up to 13 points more and Jason scores up to 29 points more).\r\n    This would give NN the 5 seed. He also can make it as the roto leader for\r\n    the 6 seed. Noah is currently 7 points behind the current 6 seed leader.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Folbe:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a win, playoffs guaranteed, anywhere between 3 and 5 seed\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a loss, out unless either NN loses while scoring less than Folbe and\r\n    Jart does not outscore Folbe by 13. This would give Folbe the 5 seed. He\r\n    also can make it as the roto leader for the 6 seed. Folbe is currently 8\r\n    points behind the current 6 seed leader, but a loss to Jart that gets Jart\r\n    to the 5 seed would mean Folbe only trails roto leader (Brad) by 3 points\r\n    currently.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Jart:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a win, if he outscores Folbe by 12.6 and NN by 13.6 (in an NN loss),\r\n    Jart is 5 seed. If either of those does not occur, needs to maintain roto\r\n    lead, with the closest person currently 5 spots behind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a loss, needs to maintain roto lead, with the closest person currently\r\n    5 spots behind. Out if Dmichs or CJ ends up competing for the 6 seed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Jason:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a win, needs NN and Folbe to lose, and to outscore NN by 29.5, Folbe\r\n    by 28.5, and Jart by 16.9. This would give Jason the 5 seed. He also can\r\n    make it as the roto leader for the 6 seed. Jason is currently 9 points\r\n    behind the current 6 seed leader, if Jart gets the 5 seed that would mean\r\n    Jason only trails roto leader (Brad) by 4 points currently.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a loss, can make it as the roto leader for the 6 seed. Jason is\r\n    currently 9 points behind the current 6 seed leader, if Jart gets the 5\r\n    seed that would mean Jason only trails roto leader (Brad) by 4 points\r\n    currently.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Bank:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    By my best calculations, Bank has a 0.01% chance. To make it, he needs to\r\n    lead in PF this week (and thus win), Jart to be the 5 seed, Brad to score 0\r\n    or 1 in roto, NN to score 0-2, Folbe to score 0-3, MW to score 0-4, and\r\n    Jason to score 0-5.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Brad:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Win/loss is irrelevant. Needs either Jart to become the 5 seed, giving him\r\n    the current roto lead to maintain, or to catch Jart (currently trails by 5\r\n    points) and to hold off other contenders.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>MW:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Win/loss is irrelevant. Needs either Jart to become the 5 seed, meaning he\r\n    only trails current leader by 3, or to catch Jart (currently trails by 8\r\n    points) and to hold off other contenders.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Nooni:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>This Week\u2019s Matchups</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Real Brothers vs Team Horses: </em></strong>\r\n    A fun rematch, this is one of the few matchups where H2H is really a big\r\n    difference maker in making the playoffs or not. A win seals a spot for\r\n    Folbe, but a loss puts him in murky waters. Some key byes (Waddle, Sanders,\r\n    Hurts) has these teams not quite at full strength, along with the continued\r\n    injury to D\u2019Andre Swift (and potentially Joe Burrow). Folbe is healthier\r\n    right now, and Josh Allen is going to be playing pissed against a very\r\n    vulnerable secondary. There\u2019s a lot of question marks here (Hubbard,\r\n    Penny), but Folbe seems like the safer pick with how Jart has been playing\r\n    lately. We like <em>Team Horses by 65.4.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jart: \u201cOh boy oh boy oh boy. What a season it has been. So many ups and\r\n    downs, it is fitting to play the guy I lost to in the biggest MNF sweat by\r\n    .4 on a Hurts scramble on 4th down. I got nothing but respect for Team\r\n    Horses. I wish Beta Metcalf was gonna be out there but excited to leave it\r\n    all on the field this week. The Family knows the mission, and as long as we\r\n    give it everything we\u2019ve got, we can live with the outcome\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Folbe: \u201cI hope you win Jarrett. I deserve nothing this year\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>I Got a Half Chubb vs United Nations: </em></strong>\r\n    Some of us are fans of the game. Some of us are fans of CJ. This writer is\r\n    a fan of both. MW has assembled quite a bit of firepower at the top all of\r\n    a sudden with Herbert and Javonte really coming on, but Frank Moreau\r\n    doesn\u2019t quite have it. For CJ, Rodgers against the Bears off a bye is sexy,\r\n    Chubb-Dmont-Dhop-Andrews is a scary group, and the team needs a win to have\r\na continued shot at the 2 seed. We like    <em>I Got a Half Chubb by 14.4.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    MW: \u201cNot focused on the matchup, focused on roto\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    CJ: \u201cLet\u2019s ride into the playoffs \ud83e\udd84\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>NN vs Mike Williams WR1: </em></strong>\r\n    Our future league winner against our playoff hopeful. While we like both to\r\n    make the playoffs because Jart is a joke, there is way too much proven\r\n    firepower on NN\u2019s team that even Brad\u2019s team that has been playing hot\r\n    lately cannot keep up. We already know Najee popped off too, supporting NN\r\n    coasting this week. We like <em>NN by 26.6</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    NN: \u201cThanks Najee\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Brad: \u201cIM COMING FOR IT ALL- \u2018Aidan Hutchinson\u2019 - \u2018Brad\u2019\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Pray for Ridley vs Nooni: </em></strong>\r\n    Two very uninspired teams who I expect to put forth a very uninspired\r\n    effort. Nooni doesn\u2019t even have a full roster at this point, so Bank will\r\n    get the win and at least have some momentum going into the consolation\r\n    playoffs. We like <em>Pray For Ridley by 32.2.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em> </em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Bank: \u201cMe vs nooni is like watching msu play osu in football two studs but\r\n    just doesn\u2019t mean *poop* for the playoffs\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Nooni: \u201cMy matchup this week doesn\u2019t matter\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team Ross vs CalAmari Cooper: </em></strong>\r\n    I woulda picked Dmichs, but after what Dalvin and Joseph did on TNF, it\u2019s\r\n    gotta change. This is statement week for Aross, and while that sucks for\r\n    the rest of the league (if NN and Folbe win), there is not much we can do\r\nabout it. We like <em>Team Ross by 22.3</em>. No Jonathan Taylor = No Win.    <em></em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Alex: \u201cGood win Dmichs really want this one as I can\u2019t watch football next\r\n    Sunday unless I leave LA at 6am which I\u2019ll do regardless\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dmichs: \u201cAlex is going down this week despite his early lead, I promise\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>GRIDDY GANG vs Team ACL Tear: </em></strong>\r\n    After the first quarter of TNF, it looked like Jase was gonna score 200.\r\n    Now we\u2019re left with some question marks on his side, as Kamara+Burkhead is\r\n    probably the most intriguing \u201cwho knows what to expect\u201d backfield duo this\r\n    week. There is simply too much on JL\u2019s side regardless of who he starts at\r\n    FLEX, and Jason\u2019s playoff hopes ultimately come up short, with the injury\r\n    to Derrick Henry being the easy thing to point back to as where it all fell\r\napart. We still love GRIDDY GANG, but we like    <em>Team ACL Tear by 27.4</em> this week.<em></em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em> </em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    JL: \u201cNeed a Jase W\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jase:<strong><em> </em></strong>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I get to play Jonah twice.\r\n    Really sums up my luck\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Best Player at Each Position</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    QB: Matt Stafford, NN\u2019s Bench\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Dalvin Cook, Aross (is this cheating?)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Cooper Kupp, NN\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    TE: Travis Kelce, Dmichs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    D/ST: Whoever he starts, JL\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    K: Brandon McManus, FA\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Family Award</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    For the way the boys have rallied together and put up some big\r\n    performances, Brad is our winner for the Family Award. If the squad rolls\r\n    out matching shoulder harnesses, I like Aross to win the award next week.\r\n</p>\r\n"}
