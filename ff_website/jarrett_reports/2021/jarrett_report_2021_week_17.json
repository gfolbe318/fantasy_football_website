Will he have 4 kids? Only if hotels expand\r\n        their room sizes!

While he may be good at examining\r\n        your butt, would is he can\u2019t always keep his under control. So bring\r\n        some nose plugs to be safe!

A real wild card, no one\r\n        knows what they would get in this car ride! Would they be forced to\r\n        pray the whole time and sing worship music? Based on yalls ratings,\r\n        that seems to be what you think!

This man apparently wants to spend every minute of his life\r\n        alone unless its briefly with his girlfriend, so he doesn\u2019t seem like\r\n        the guy to take! But it\u2019ll be a good time and a lot of talk about the\r\ntranscendent talent that is Cooper Kupp. It\u2019s        <strong>Noah Nathan</strong>!\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        In 3rd place, with a score of 83 points, a highest finish of 1st and a\r\n        lowest finish of 11th, it\u2019s the CEO of Fantasy Dickball himself! Some\r\n        thought he would reach second on this list, but that is not the case! A\r\n        fearless leader who will help usher in the age of the auction dynasty,\r\n        it is none other than <strong>Alex Ross</strong>!\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        In 2nd place, with a score of 85 points, a highest finish of 1st and a\r\n        lowest finish of DQ, it is the man whose drunk videos saturate the\r\n        league groupchat in the offseason! His fantasy team may absolutely\r\n        blow, but that won\u2019t stop him from thinking its good and telling you\r\n        about it! For a good time, call <strong>Brad Silverman</strong>!\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        In 1st place, with a score of 94 points, a highest finish of 1st and a\r\n        lowest finish of 7th, it\u2019s The Programmer!

This\r\n    was the best season we have ever had, everyone is locked in, and bright\r\n    things are ahead.

Really it\u2019s the gorilla\u2019s pure size\r\n    and weight that make them dangerous. Consider the chicken if it were\r\n    gorilla sized. This is a terrifying animal that can survive even if you cut\r\n    their heads off. That\u2019s an impossible obstacle to overcome, whereas ten\r\n    chicken sized gorillas can be defeated.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Over under 50000 text messages sent between tomorrow and start of the\r\n        2023 regular season in the group chat?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Over. We have 8 months before the regular season starts, meaning roughly\r\n    240 days. To reach 50000 text messages, we should need to send around 210 a\r\n    day.

Do you feel the same?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Yes. I am ok with roto impacting up to two playoff spots, but nothing\r\n    beyond that. Fantasy Football is a H2H game, and we can never move away\r\n    from that. Otherwise we will have lost the joy of matchups and locking in\r\n    on your opponents.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Can you pitch me a little more on auction?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Throughout the season we hear of situations such as with Diontae Johnson,\r\n    where Noah wanted him but CJ \u201csniped him\u201d. We just don\u2019t have that issue\r\n    anymore with an auction draft. Auction lets you call your shot. If you feel\r\n    really good about a guy that is supposed to go later? Great, spend a little\r\n    less there and go big on some early guys you really like. You would have\r\n    more control over your roster than ever. Especially as we move through\r\n    rounds in snake, people will come up at say the 32nd pick but want someone\r\n    who they could get at 38, but they just don\u2019t have the ability to do that,\r\n    and so they have to reach some. With an auction, they can be rewarded some\r\n    for paying less for the 38th guy, and have more to spend elsewhere. I hear\r\n    a lot of talk about how the auction draft is too long, but then also how\r\n    the draft is the best part of the season. I don\u2019t know how anyone can\r\n    really make a decision until we try it. Seems like next year is a great\r\n    year to test it out as we have such a solid core and league right now\r\n    committed to creating the ultimate experience. We won\u2019t know until we try!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Can we do an off-season Jart Report?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Yes, of course! Interviews will be beginning shortly on team recaps (I\r\n    would like to video chat with each of you individually if possible), as\r\n    well as some other things I may cook up. Suggestions are always welcome,\r\n    unless you had me last in your car rankings.

Hard to beat Cooper Kupp, but Swift-Chase-Hurts does it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Trade #2: Daniel Banooni and Jarrett Black</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Daniel Banooni Received:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    3rd overall pick - Alvin Kamara\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    27th overall pick - Allen Robinson\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    70th overall pick - Raheem Mostert\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    142nd overall pick - Russell Gage\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jarrett Black Received:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    11th overall pick - Saquon Barkley\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    14th overall pick - Tyreek Hill\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    62nd overall pick - Brandin Cooks\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    134th overall pick - Steelers D/ST\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Winner: </strong>\r\n    Jarrett Black. Neither team incredibly benefitted, but Kamara and Mostert\r\n    struggled with injuries, Allen Robinson did nothing, and Gage didn\u2019t\r\n    produce until he was gone. Saquon was a disappointment with injuries,\r\n    Tyreek was boom/bust, but Brandin Cooks was flipped for Davante Adams.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Trade #3: Alex Ross and Daniel Michaels</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Alex Ross Received:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    61st overall pick - Lamar Jackson\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    84th overall pick - Antonio Brown\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Daniel Michaels Received:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    71st overall pick - Odell Beckham Jr.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    74th overall pick - Juju Smith-Schuster\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Winner: Alex Ross. A lot of real interesting players are included here.\r\n    Juju missed most of the season, Odell and AB both had quite the sagas, and\r\n    Lamar played pretty well but missed a number of games with injury. Lamar\r\n    wins the deal though.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Trade #4: Merrick Bank and Brad Silverman</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Merrick Bank Received:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    82nd overall pick - Tom Brady\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    87th overall pick - Devonta Smith\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Brad Silverman Received:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    80th overall pick - Tyler Boyd\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    89th overall pick - Kenyan Drake\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Winner: Merrick Bank. Tom Brady was a top QB, and Devonta Smith was a solid\r\n    contributor. Tyler Boyd was inconsistent and Kenyan Drake wasn\u2019t good until\r\n    Brad dropped him and Kenyan spent some time back with his Family.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    Season Awards\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    With the fantasy season officially coming to an end, it is time to look\r\n    back on the season and hand out the awards for a whole slew of different\r\n    things.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Draft Pick of the Year:</strong>\r\n    Noah Nathan, Cooper Kupp, 46th overall\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Worst Draft Pick of the Year:</strong>\r\n    Daniel Banooni, Allen Robinson, 27th overall\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Trade Of the Year:</strong>\r\n    Brad Silverman-Jarrett Black.
