Tee popping and DK struggling will likely not be the norm, and\r\n    Allen provides an elite floor in production, but I think Alex got the\r\n    better deal here.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Trade #2:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Aross: Antonio Brown, Myles Gaskin (Grade: B+)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Bank: Aaron Jones (Grade: A)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    While week one certainly favored Bank, and will again this week with Aaron\r\n    Jones on bye, the deal is not terrible for Aross either. Gaskin has been\r\n    extremely sporadic, AB continues to deal with injury, and Aaron Jones has\r\n    incredible upside. Alex needed some guys who can go get 40 to have a shot,\r\n    and no shame in going and getting one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Jart\u2019s Mailbag</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who is the most likely league member to go broke?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Gotta feel like it\u2019s CJ with the size of his units in gambling. Certainly\r\n    not Brad. Sneaky pick? MW once Peloton closes up shop.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        With all the injuries to running backs taken in spots 1-4 of this years\r\n        draft, are these spots going to be seen as valuable next year?

I think of a guy like\r\n    Austin Ekeler who missed a lot of time last year, but is RB2 this year. RBs\r\njust remain too valuable currently to go in any other direction.    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Will cmac go in the 10th round or undrafted next year?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Good question MW, I can tell you\u2019re feeling scorned. Despite the season he\r\n    had this year with injuries, and the history he has formed, he is way too\r\n    talented when healthy to fall out of the first round in my opinion.

A couple\r\n    of my takeaways from that time were that:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        A car ride with Do The John Wall, Rappers Delight, and Forever is not a\r\n        bad car ride.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        We really did whatever we wanted in middle school.

Wild times.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Does your team feel like a Family right now?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Yes, if it was a dysfunctional family that kinda hated each other and did\r\n    bad things just to spite each other. There\u2019s a lot to figure out, and it\u2019s\r\n    been tough to parent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>On To Week Thirteen!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong> </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>This Week\u2019s Matchups:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team Ross vs Team Horses: </em></strong>\r\n    Two teams both in need of a win to feel more secure in their playoff\r\n    standings, there\u2019s a lot of familiar faces on opposing teams now following\r\n    their trade last week. The matchup boasts two of the most electric QBs in\r\n    the league in Lamar and Allen, along with some fun players in\r\n    Mattison-Fournette-DK-Keenan. On paper Folbe seems to have a slight\r\n    advantage in the RB2 and FLEX department, while the rest seems to be pretty\r\n    even. A lot of players on both teams have turned in uneven performances\r\n    making it somewhat difficult to predict, but Folbe seems like the safer\r\n    pick, so we like <em>Team Horses by 12.4</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Aross: \u201cNo comment at this time\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Folbe: \u201cAlex\u2019s roster resembles Frankenstein. Lot of pieces pulled together\r\n    that somehow get the job done. Knowing that I traded him Tee and DK he\u2019ll\r\n    get the win against me. Good win\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>I Got a Half Chubb vs Team ACL Tear: </em></strong>\r\n    It just seems unwise to pick against JL right now, even with Deebo on bye.\r\n    No Rodgers and Chubb certainly limit CJ\u2019s upside, but both teams still look\r\n    solid from the top to bottom. The return of Kyler Murray will be\r\n    interesting to watch more for the longevity of JL\u2019s team than anything, but\r\nright now I do not want to bet against Ekeler-Mixon-Lamb-Gronk. We like    <em>Team ACL Tear by 15.6</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    JL: \u201cDeebo out. GG CJ\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    CJ: \u201cTough one with Jonah this week\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Nooni vs Mike Williams WR1: </em></strong>\r\n    Brad is looking hot right now while Nooni may finish last in PF every week\r\n    moving forward. Mahomes-Gibson-Cordarelle-Eli is looking really nice\r\n    currently, while Nooni should have a bounceback week with Jamaal likely\r\n    starting and Derek having a nice matchup. Additionally, Godwin and Evans\r\n    should get back on track after horrendous weeks, while Gesicki draws a nice\r\n    matchup too. I need to call an upset somewhere this week, and as karma for\r\nBrad declining my Mahomes-Gibson for Hurts-Chase offer, we like    <em>Nooni by 6.7.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Nooni: \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak on those\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Brad: \u201cI got nooni? LOL\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Real Brothers vs United Nations: </em></strong>\r\n    Both of these teams are truly bringing out their backups this week in what\r\n    will truly be a war of attrition. Both teams will be missing big names\r\n    (both in real life and in fantasy) this week between injuries and byes.\r\n    There still remain a lot of question marks health wise that will dictate\r\n    this matchup, but Jart seems to have slightly more depth than MW currently,\r\n    and for that reason we like <em>Real Brothers by 3.3, </em>a result the\r\n    whole league can get behind for Roto purposes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em> </em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jart: \u201cWho knows. It\u2019s literally a guessing game every week with my team.\r\n    Maybe we\u2019ll do ok this week, maybe we won\u2019t. Glad I have a roto cushion,\r\n    although that may evaporate this week\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    MW: \u201cI hope Jart wins \ud83d\ude0a\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>NN vs CalAmari Cooper: </em></strong>\r\n    NN needs this one badly to have a shot at the playoffs, while Dmichs is in\r\n    a close race for the 2 seed and coveted first round bye. While there are a\r\n    lot of factors here that could dictate, Jonathan Taylor facing Houston\r\n    seems to be the trump card above all else. Projected an astronomical 22.8\r\n    points, he should easily surpass even the loftiest of expectations, and\r\n    could put forth another 40+ point performance. Najee+Kupp+Diggs will\r\n    certainly fight, but we like <em>CalAmari Cooper by 11.5.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    NN: \u201cGood win DMichs, happy for you\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dmichs: \u201cThis week I\u2019m taking NN\u2019s cheeks\u2026then I\u2019m gunna beat him in\r\n    fantasy\u2026pause\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>GRIDDY GANG vs Pray For Ridley: </em></strong>\r\n    More than a win, these teams need roto points to have a chance at the 6\r\n    seed. RB2 continues to be a major concern for Jase, but Rex Burkhead seems\r\n    to be sliding back into the role this week unless Miles Sanders is unable\r\n    to go (health of Kamara lingering). The FLEX here is perhaps the most\r\n    entertaining piece, as it features two former superstars in Antonio Brown\r\n    and OBJ. Both have nice matchups, but it is the consistency of James\r\n    Conner, and Tom Brady getting back on track against a terrible Atlanta\r\n    team, that we like to push Bank over the top and back into contention.
