{"title": "The Last Lance", "season": 2022, "week": "2", "report": "<p>\r\n    Welcome back to another Jart Report, where we  are currently mourning the\r\n    loss of brother Trey Lance to a gruesome injury. The  $33 man will be deeply\r\n    missed, but Danny Dimes knows that it is next man up.  More than anything,\r\n    the Report is upset that Trey\u2019s injury cost a chance to  shut MW up for a\r\n    week. But alas, let\u2019s get underway with another report after a  fun Week\r\n    Two!\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Week Two Recap:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Expand the IR vs Alyssa Robinson:</em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Prediction: <em>Expand the IR by 14.5</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Reality: <em>Expand the IR by 41.12</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cGood game\u201d - Bank\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cMB won the battle but I\u2019ll win the war.\u201d -  Brad\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em></em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team ACL Tear vs Team Nooni:</em></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Prediction: <em>Team Nooni by 27.3</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Reality: <em>Team Nooni by 20.92</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cEmbarrassing performance by my team.

The things he is doing are absurd, and also  keeping Alex afloat\r\n    amidst disappointing RB play and very mediocre QBs. A 116  yard day and 2\r\n    TDs is becoming more the expected than the exception for this  young gun who\r\n    knows every WR drafted before him, and as long as Goff keeps  slinging it\r\n    and proving that Sean McVay is a bust, the Lions will keep on  putting up\r\n    points. What a botch by MW to not have this excellent Lion on his  squad.\r\n    Congratulations to Amon-Ra on being Him Larra\u00f1aga this week!\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Who\u2019s Back Of The Week?</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Team:</strong>Nooni! Buddy you won! I\u2019m so proud of you. The QB\r\n    situation is  obviously very concerning here, but Kelce is a cheat code, and\r\n    the RBs and  Jaylen Waddle look great long term.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: Bank. 1st in PF (stupid  Hurts INT) this week, this team\r\n    is going to go as far as the Bills do. While  Diggs\u2019 numbers should reduce\r\n    with Gabe Davis back in action, there\u2019s a lot to  like with Herbert and\r\n    Allen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Player:</strong>Nick Chubb. Happy to toot my own horn here, as Chubb\r\n    is currently RB1 with a 3 TD performance, and while Hunt will continue to\r\n    linger, he certainly has bellcow status heading into a Thursday night\r\n    matchup  with the Steelers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: Tyreek Hill. New city? No  problem. Scoring 30 fantasy\r\n    points in 7 minutes of game time is absurd.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Something  Else:</strong>The Miami Dolphins. My QB board going into\r\n    the  draft was Hurts, Kyler, Tua, Lance. In that order. Don\u2019t ask me why I\r\n    took  Lance. Levine can attest to how hard I tried to trade for Tua before\r\n    the season  began.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: The Detroit Lions. Despite  NN\u2019s best efforts, there\u2019s no\r\n    stopping this squad from going forward down the  field. One pride baby.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Who\u2019s Not Back Of The Week?</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Team:</strong>Folbe. A full on fire sale might not be required yet,\r\n    but Matt Ryan is  looking atrocious, the RB room is questionable at best,\r\n    and the WRs are not yet  producing at the level one would hope. Things could\r\n    certainly turn around, but  through two weeks the outlook is bleak.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: JL. The 1-1 record is a  nice facade for a team that has\r\n    only scored 0.6 points more than Folbe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Player:</strong>Trey Lance. After struggling week one, Trey\u2019s season\r\n    is officially over. Thanks for the 12 points buddy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: Alvin Kamara. We\u2019ll see if  he can get back on the field\r\n    and produce, but let me tell you this, this writer  does not value him\r\n    higher than current RB1 Nick Chubb.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Something  Else: \u201c</strong>Him\u201d. The NFL killed it. But we retain\r\n    the Jart  Report segment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: Top RBs. With no RB scoring  at least 17 points in each\r\n    of the first two weeks, there has not been much  consistency at the position\r\n    where a lot of money was spent in our auction.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Transaction Analysis:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Best  Transaction:</strong> Curtis Samuel, $14. We\u2019ll see how long\r\n    this lasts with the competition in that WR room, but a shrewd bid by Bank\r\n    has  gotten him a very nice FLEX option.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: Treylon Burks, $0. He seems  to be the clear-cut WR1 in\r\n    Tennessee, whose role should hopefully grow as he  gets acclimated and fills\r\n    AJB\u2019s shoes. QB play is going to be a major issue  though.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Worst  Transaction:</strong> Rex Burkhead, $26. A RB who got no\r\n    carries. Zero. Oof. GBR though.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Honorable Mention: Geno Smith, $22. Maybe this  one will prove to be\r\n    alright. But MW could have got him for $1, and Geno looked  pretty below\r\n    average this week.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Record by PF Finish:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    1st: 2-0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    2nd: 2-0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    3rd: 2-0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    4th: 0-2\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    5th: 1-1\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    6th: 0-2\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    7th: 1-1\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    8th: 1-1\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    9th: 2-0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    10th: 0-2\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    11th: 1-1\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    12th: 0-2\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Worst Possible Lineup:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    QB: Jameis Winston, 7.64 points, Nooni\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Rex Burkhead, 1.9 points, Brad\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Cordarelle Patterson, 4.1 points, Dmichs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: DJ Chark, 0 points, Levine\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Darnell Mooney, 0.1 points, Brad (congrats  to Darnell on back to back\r\n    weeks) <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    TE: Dalton Schultz, 1.8 points, Aross\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    FLEX: Rashaad Penny, 1.5 points, Levine\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    SUPERFLEX: Ryan Tannehill, 0.88 points, Nooni\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    D/ST: Indy D/ST, 0 points, JL\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Total  Points: 17.92</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Would it have beaten Folbe:\r\n    <strong>\r\n        No sir, but maybe in a couple weeks\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Best Possible Lineup:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    QB: Tua Tagovailoa, 38.86 points, Levine\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Nick Chubb, 30.8 points, Jart\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Aaron Jones, 30.5 points, Jase\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Stefon Diggs, 38.8 points, Bank\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Jaylen Waddle, 34.6 points, Nooni\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    TE: Mark Andrews, 25.7 points, Levine\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    FLEX: Tyreek Hill, 36.5 points, MW\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    SUPERFLEX: Lamar Jackson, 42.62 points, Brad\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    D/ST: Bucs D/ST, 24.0 points, Dmichs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Total  Points: 302.38</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Would  it have beaten Dwitt in 2019: Yeesh, this OP is OP!</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Best Benchwarmer Lineup:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    QB: Carson Wentz, 27.78 points, NN (once  again!)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Tony Pollard, 17.8 points, Nooni\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    RB: Damien Harris, 15.7 points, Nooni\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Garrett Wilson, 26.0 points, Jase\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    WR: Christian Kirk, 22.8 points, Jart (once  again!)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    TE: Hunter Henry, 0.0 points, Dmichs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    FLEX: Drake London, 20.6 points, Folbe\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    SUPERFLEX: Amari Cooper, 20.6 points, Levine\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    D/ST: Pittsburgh D/ST, 2.0 points, Dmichs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Total  Points: 153.28</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>How  many teams would it have beaten this week: All 12</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>The Trade Jartalyzer:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Trade  #1:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Brad: George Kittle, Ceedee Lamb, Matt Ryan  (Grade: B-)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Folbe: Lamar Jackson, Isiah Pacheco (Grade:  A-)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    We begin to see the effect of the Superflex.  Lamar looks electric, and it\r\n    enters Folbe into the stack squad with Bateman.  For Brad, the dynamic QB\r\n    duo is lost, and instead a risky 2-TE set has been  formed. If Kittle can\r\n    stay healthy and Matt Ryan can be average, this has  potential. But as of\r\n    right now, Folbe has gotten a more sure thing and improved  his standing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Trade  #2:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jason: Davis Mills (Grade: B+)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Brad: George Pickens (Grade: C-)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    George Pickens will be a baller one day.

Just  a lot of good times with friends!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Thorn:</strong> I have to read a book and write a book report on it\r\n    for seminary this  week along with all of my normal tasks. Just got a lot to\r\n    do, and it is going  to take up pretty much all of my remaining free time\r\n    this week! My professor is  also a very tough grader, so I need to do a very\r\n    good job on this assignment. I  have very bad senioritis as this is my last\r\n    semester, but we gotta buckle down  and knock it out! It has been a good\r\n    week overall though :)\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Jart\u2019s Mailbag:</strong> <strong></strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who is Nebraska hiring?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The top three candidates released today are  Leipold, Campbell, and BOB. I\u2019m\r\n    guessing Matt Rhule is also a top candidate,  but he of course needs to be\r\n    fired by the Panthers first. Campbell seems like  the safest pick, but I\r\n    personally hope that it is Rhule.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Rank the league in order of how many  beers they could drink without\r\n        having to pee?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        Folbe\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jason\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        NN\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Levine\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jart\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Aross\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Nooni\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        JL\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Bank\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Brad\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        MW\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Will Jason be able to surpass his  longest win streak of 2 games (per\r\n        bloomfieldfantasyreference.com)?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Yes! That is a team that I really love from  top to bottom, and if the win\r\n    streak is snapped it will be because his opponent  went off rather than a\r\n    poor showing on his end. Dare I say the win streak will  be 5+ at some point\r\n    this season? I do dare say so.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Please rank the Nebraska job in CFB?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    After establishing that it is T-3 in the Big  Ten this week, I think we need\r\n    to look at the reality that there are only a few  conferences offering top\r\n    jobs at this point as realignment occurs. In the ACC,  only Clemson would be\r\n    ahead at this point, although even that is beginning to  fade. The future\r\n    SEC offers Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma, and LSU ahead of  Nebraska. In\r\n    considering the Pac-12, I would only put USC above Nebraska,  although\r\n    Oregon may be close. So all in all, I would say it is tied for the 11th\r\n    best job in the country! <strong> <br/>\r\n    <br/>\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who will have the cutest babies?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Cutest? For sure MW. He\u2019s so fricken cute. And  Amanda should make a great\r\n    mother. I\u2019m not sure if JL could answer this  question though, as I don\u2019t\r\n    think he\u2019s looked at Amanda\u2019s face before.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Will Marcus Mariota outscore Trey  Lance this season?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Touche. A little rude considering Lance just  broke himself, but yes,\r\n    Mariota will. But probably not by a ton #RidderSznSoon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Is this the Bills team that finally  breaks through?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Through two weeks, I would be hard pressed to  pick any other team. In\r\n    general I would take the field over a specific team,  especially because a\r\n    Josh Allen injury would derail the season very quickly (he  really does need\r\n    to learn to slide). If I had to pick a team right now though,  it would be\r\n    the Bills with zero hesitation. I just hope their defense can  continue to\r\n    average 17 PPG.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>How does it feel to be 0-2? Can\u2019t  relate.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Not too bad. In a pre-roto era it would be  very tough, since I have been\r\n    Top 6 in PF both weeks. But ultimately, the wins  and losses only matter for\r\n    getting a top 4 seed. And our goal is just to make  the playoffs, and let\r\n    whatever happen from there. Right now the main concern is  building a great\r\n    roster from top to bottom, and while the Lance injury presents  a big\r\n    concern, we are feeling very good about every other spot!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who is the Jalen Hurts of the NBA?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    If this question is who is my favorite player  in the NBA, then the answer\r\n    is Damian Lillard. However, it seems to be more  from a budding star talent\r\n    level. It may be too early to give Hurts this level  of praise, but I would\r\n    say Luka. A young guy who is developing into an absolute  stud before our\r\n    eyes, and that Hurts celebration on the dot to Quez Watkins  gave me chills.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Would you rather have Lamar or  Kittle?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Would I rather have an elite QB in a Superflex  league or a TE who can never\r\n    stay healthy and has Jimmy G at Quarterback? Hmm.  Definitely Lamar. I think\r\n    Lamar puts Folbe right into contention in a way that  he simply was not\r\n    before, and the WR and TE positions are deep enough that  ultimately Folbe\r\n    will get similar production from those spots. Big win for him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who has your favorite roster in UNIT?  Least favorite?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Favorite:</strong> Jason (shocker, I know). I don\u2019t see that team\r\n    scoring under 100 this  season, and sometimes, consistency is king. This\r\n    week showed that they can go  to the 150 mark too.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Least  Favorite:</strong> Brad. There\u2019s just nothing that jumps out\r\n    at  you as elite. RBs are bad, WRs are mid, and the TE could be good but has\r\n    a lot  to prove.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Are you interested in acquiring a QB  or is Danny Dimes your guy?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Yes to both. I am not actively pursuing a  trade for a QB currently, but as\r\n    guys slide into my DMs I am entering into  conversations about their QBs to\r\n    gauge where people are at. Thought I made a  pretty fair counter tonight,\r\n    but sometimes you just don\u2019t see fully eye-to-eye!  I do like Danny Dimes\u2019\r\n    upside in a Brian Daboll offense, and don\u2019t forget that  he is faster than\r\n    Lamar. Getting Saquon loose in the passing game could prove  lethal,\r\n    although it would be nice to see Kenny Golladay not be trash.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Who wins the NFC North?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I really want to pick the Lions. But it is not  our time yet. Really can\u2019t\r\n    pick anyone besides the Packers at this point, even  after the Vikings beat\r\n    them in Week One. Lazard gives the Packers more  stability at WR, and it is\r\n    not yet time to feel okay about picking against  Rodgers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>If you had to pick a league winner  today, who would it be?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jason. I think a high fantasy floor is huge  given the volatility of fantasy\r\n    football. You need to have 2-3 solid weeks to  win the championship, and his\r\n    team is the one that I currently feel best about.  But we also know that for\r\n    all teams, but especially a Jason managed team,  injuries are likely on the\r\n    horizon and will shake things up in a major way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Why is fantasy so dumb?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Because head coaches don\u2019t care about fantasy  football, as we learned from\r\n    the Falcons and Kyle Pitts this week. And so we\u2019re  just at the mercy of\r\n    game flow and what coaches want to do that week. And then  players get hurt,\r\n    and you have to try your best to rise above the rest in the  crapshoot. It\r\n    is overall a great time! <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Will CJ ever try to make a run to  join the league again? Will we accept\r\n        him?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Nah, I think he really is done this time. But  if he did, I do not think the\r\n    league would accept him. He played with too many  hearts for too long!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        How tf is Brian Robinson practicing?  This guy got shot in his legs\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Nick Saban\u2019s deal with the devil extends to  all of his former players as\r\n    well. And frankly Antonio Gibson does not deserve  a starting role, so I am\r\n    hopeful that Robinson can get back to playing soon. He  is a very easy guy\r\n    to root for moving forward!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        You have one league member to make a  free throw, a putt, and a 25 yard\r\n        field goal to save your life, who do you  choose and why (One person for\r\n        all three)?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    I will take Aross, although Folbe was a close  second. Those just all seem\r\n    like things that Alex can do with little to no  issue. At the same time, I\r\n    think Folbe might be more concerned about saving my  life. So maybe I will\r\n    take Folbe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>What is a reasonable bid for Jimmy G?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    One dollar more than what someone else bids  for him! As someone who has\r\n    placed a $1 bid for Jimmy G, I feel I can speak  openly on this one. I would\r\n    say anything under $30 is reasonable. You are  hoping to get a solid QB2\r\n    here, and that can fill a big gap for some team. FAAB  does have value, but\r\n    its value is to help fill gaps, and this is a clear  opportunity to do so.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>\r\n        Who does the report think the worst  team in the NFL is at the moment?\r\n    </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In a close one between the Titans and  Panthers, we will lean towards the\r\n    Titans. The defense looks lost, Tannehill  looks terrible, without AJB\r\n    around teams can key in on Henry more. There is  hope, and the development\r\n    of Burks could be huge for the offense, but they have  a lot to prove. The\r\n    Panthers are pretty bad though, they should definitely fire  Matt Rhule and\r\n    they should fire him as soon as possible so he can move on with  his life\r\n    and be at a place where he belongs and can win many games and be what  Scott\r\n    Frost could not be.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Mailbag Question of the Week:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>How long until all league members are  back living in MI?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This question wins primarily because multiple  of you asked me it and that\r\n    was funny. I think we will see the whole league  return by 2028, so around\r\n    the time everyone is 30. I plan on being back by July  2023, and once we\r\n    start rolling out the live, in-person auction drafts, people  will be\r\n    flooding back to the great state of Michigan. Especially with the Lions\r\n    looking better, Ashton getting the Pistons right, and all of us getting jobs\r\n    at  SANA. I will guess that JL is the final one.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Mailbag Question Asking Standings:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jason (26)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Bank (17)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Brad (15)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        NN (12)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        MW (12)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Folbe (8)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        JL (6)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Nooni (4)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Levine (3)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs (2)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Aross (1)\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>League Takes:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Agree:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -MWs WR strategy is paying off\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -Team Ross is clearly anti team Levine -anon\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -MB makes the playoffs somehow\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -Brad gonna make a really dumb trade soon that  works out for him\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Neutral:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -MW misses playoffs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -Levine will get hot\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Disagree:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -Jarrett starts 0-3 and then makes playoffs\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -Merrick vs Merrick final\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -Scott frost will soon be an assistant at bama  for nick saban\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -There will be a 5 time league Champion after  this year\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Jart\u2019s Power Rankings:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        MW (+2)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jason (+4)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Bank (+4)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Levine (+1)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        NN (-4)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Jart (-2)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Nooni (+5)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Dmichs (-6)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Folbe (+2)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Brad (-1)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Alex (-3)\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        JL (-2)\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <strong>Week Three:</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Expand the IR</em>vs <em>Team Levine</em>:</strong> Both of\r\n    these teams are coming off electric weeks from their QBs, with Bank\u2019s\r\n    looking like the safer bet to replicate such high level performances. Both\r\n    Tua  and Goff look very promising though, so there could be a lot of\r\n    fireworks from  the signal callers once again in this matchup. RB is a bit\r\n    of a scary spot for  both of these teams currently, but the bellcow status\r\n    of Najee gives Levine a  slight edge. At WR, we love JJeffs to bounce back\r\n    in a major way after a very  disjointed MNF from the Vikings. TE could be a\r\n    lot of fun this week, and we  actually like Knox slightly more. Overall,\r\n    this should be a fun, high-scoring  affair, but\r\n    <em>\r\n        we like Expand the IR by 2.7.\r\n    </em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Bank: \u201cIdk who I play but they\u2019ll win\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Levine: No comment\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><em>Team Michaels vs. Team ACL Tear:</em></strong> While the\r\n    previous matchup brings a lot of fun QB play, these four QBs  disgust me.\r\n    Brady is washed, Kirk sucks, Trubisky should not be playing, and  Stafford\r\n    can\u2019t complete a pass to his own team. Kirk playing at noon gives the\r\n    advantage to Dmichs here though. At RB, Taylor should have an absolutely\r\n    monster day, giving Dmichs the clear edge as Kamara looks to establish\r\n    himself  this season. WR brings some fun with Adams and Chase (shout out the\r\n    2021  Family), but we trust Adams much more here due to more consistent QB\r\n    play to  this point and an awful Titans defense. Logan Thomas should\r\n    continue to bring  solid production, and overall\r\n    <em>\r\n        we like  Team Michaels by 13.4\r\n    </em>\r\n    .\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dmichs: No comment at this time\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    JL: \u201cEverything depends on Kamara and Keenan  coming back.

QB in this one is pretty gross too, but Russ and  Burrow\r\n    should both have somewhat bounceback performances after very shaky  starts\r\n    to the season. At RB, we trust Nooni\u2019s duo to come through in a major  way,\r\n    although all 4 are start and forget guys. WR and TE go to Nooni in a major\r\n    way, and thus <em>we like Nooni by 1.4 in  what should be a close one.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    NN: \u201cGood luck nooners!

However, if  McCaffrey and\r\n    Cook can get going that may be nullified. Amon-Ra in the FLEX for  Aross is\r\n    nasty, and he should be poised for another big day against a Vikings\r\n    defense that looked soft on MNF. Where Aross goes at TE to replace Schultz\r\n    should be an interesting development, but we love the floors for all of\r\n    Jason\u2019s  team across the board, and the Hurts-AJB stack should continue to\r\n    deliver. <em>We like Team Immunized by 5.6.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jase: \u201cWasn't sure how I felt about Alex's  team after the draft.

QB play  goes Folbe\u2019s\r\n    direction in a major way in this one, while Derrick Henry should  finally\r\n    get on track against a weak Raiders rush defense. The Report remains\r\n    skeptical of Miles Sanders, while Swift and Javonte make for a solid duo for\r\n    MW. WR is of course in MW\u2019s favor, but I expect Tyreek to be somewhat\r\n    limited  by a great Bills defense. This one is going to be quite\r\n    interesting, but the  Lamar acquisition may be just what Folbe\u2019s team\r\n    needed, and we like them to  ride that spark. If they go zero dark 30 mode,\r\n    it\u2019s over. <em>We like Team Horses by 0.1.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Folbe: \u201c*Insert picture of lebron james zero  dark 30 mode*\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    MW: \u201cThere\u2019s no one I have more respect for in  the league than folbe.

QB is a wash for now\r\n    as Ryan and Danny Dimes remain too unpredictable, while RB  goes to Jart\r\n    right now with Chubb and CEH both scoring as Top-5 backs through  two weeks.\r\n    WR should be interesting, and overall is best viewed as a push for  now.\r\n    While the 2-TE stack is interesting, teams that run it are so far 0-3 this\r\n    year.
